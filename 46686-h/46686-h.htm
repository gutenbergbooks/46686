<div class='c008'><span class='small'>16th.</span></div>
<p class='c009' >We dined at one, in company of some gentlemanly
Swiss and French officers, and started
at three for <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chillon</span>, passing on our way the
hamlet <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Tour du Peil</span>, and catching a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_2' id='Page_2'>2</a></span>
glimpse as we rode by of its ruined ancient
castle, pillaged and burned by order of Berne,
in punishment for having allowed the passage
of foreign soldiers to Lausanne, where lay the
camp of their foe, Charles, duke of Burgundy.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vevay</span> suffered for the like fault, being plundered
also, and of the two towns five hundred
men were massacred.</p>

<p class='c010' >There is nothing lovelier than this road,
winding along the flank of the mountains, here
rich with wood. We passed <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Clarens</span>, beautiful
as Byron’s description, hiding among its own
trees, and straggling up the hill side from the
shore. The noble old castle of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chastellar</span> on
its solitary mound, and the peaked stone spire
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montreux</span> seeming to lean against the
forest, above which the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dent de Jaman</span> stands,
cold and barren,—all the way the lake shining
below, with the stern rocks of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Meillerie</span> opposite,
and the Alps closing the valley. The
heat was excessive; and the small vineyard
flies so tormented our horses that D——’s
taste for the picturesque had well nigh
vanished, when a bend in the road brought us
beneath a high bank, covered with old walnut-trees,
and opposite the rock on which <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chillon</span>
stands, with its towers and tall keep, the most
picturesque of feudal castles. We crossed the
covered wooden bridge, where the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gendarmes</span>
stand, smiling welcome; and the horses
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_3' id='Page_3'>3</a></span>
consigned, each to the care of two, and left in a dark
stable to be dusted with walnut branches, we
were sufficiently tranquil as to their comfort to
follow our guide, who was the wife of the concierge.
She led across two courts, and opened
a heavy prison door; it was “out of the sun
and into a grave.” I obeyed her injunction
to hold fast her hand, when, having scrambled
over rubbish, and through partial darkness,
she drew me to the brink of a square hole, and
pointed down a depth of eighty-six feet. It was
one of the fearful <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">oubliettes</span>, whose existence
here was unknown till about fifteen months since.
Grown accustomed to the dim light, we could
distinguish a coarse woollen rug, now laid on the
brink, but which was found below serving as
shroud to a skeleton. The victim died from
the fall, or was left to perish. In the same
court-yard is the entrance to another, which
was, at pleasure, dungeon or place of execution.
Its depth is sixty and some feet; and from the
top of the square opening descend three steps,
the commencement of a stair which goes no
farther. The condemned was lowered to the
bottom, and his food administered in like manner.
If death was decided on, he was forgotten,
as there was no other communication with the
living world.</p>

<p class='c010' >A few steps lead to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle de justice</span>. The
dryness of the air and thickness of the walls
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_4' id='Page_4'>4</a></span>
has so preserved all within, that the curious
wooden ceiling, supported in the centre by
pillars, which retain traces of paint, remains;
and the planks of the floor were only exchanged
for pavement, when, on the threats of France,
the caissons of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Canton de Vaud</span> were
assembled here. At one end of this hall is a
small room with a door, on a now closed staircase,
near the wide chimney. At the other is
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle de question.</span> A pillar of wood, to
which the prisoner was bound, still stands,—as
does a beam above it, pierced with holes for
pulleys, and a portion of the old ropes hanging
from them. A second beam, which supported
a wheel on which the wretch was tortured, (tied
by the arms with weights to the feet,) crumbled
down a few months ago. The pillar is seared
with the red-hot irons employed in the torture;
that by burning being continued during three-quarters
of an hour, with intervals of five
minutes; if it induced confession, the private
stair from the small chamber conducted the
condemned to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">potence</span> in the dungeon
below. The door has been walled up, on
account of the vicinity of the powder magazine.
Our guide led to the eating-hall, which was
the kitchen also. The capitals of its pillars
were ornamented with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fleurs-de-lis</span>, she said,
when a count of Savoy conducted hither his
bride, a daughter of France, perhaps <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonne de
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_5' id='Page_5'>5</a></span>
Bourbon,</span> who married the green count <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span>
the Sixth, about 1355. The two carved oaken
chests with their curious locks, at the bottom
of the room, are of the same date. The view
from these windows is beautiful beyond praise,
and there is “the little isle—the only one in
view,” lying in the lake like a floating basket
of flowers. Our last visit was to the dungeons:
the first is the most modern, and least sad, as
its loopholes are longer and less narrow. On
one of the sills they form in the thick wall sat
a Swiss girl, the light falling on her picturesque
dress, touching her smiling face and
bare arms,—she animated the dim prison
house. Between this first dungeon and that
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonnivard</span>, there is one smaller and darker,
though light enough for its destination: for a
few moments’ stay allows the eye to distinguish,
crossing a space between its pillars, a heavy
beam, whose upper part is, in several places,
deeply worn by the ropes which, upholding
heavy weights, were bound round it; and a few
paces behind, the steps of the narrow stair
which conducts to the fatal door of the justice
hall. The opposite wall, against which the
lake ripples or foams in its various moods, has
a square cavity, now closed with stones; the
bodies of those who died unheard and unseen
were cast forth there, and beneath the waves
which told no tales. A narrow portal opens
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_6' id='Page_6'>6</a></span>
on the dungeon where <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonnivard</span> lay. I
think I reminded you before that he was prior
of the abbey of St. Victor, a man of pure life
as well as courage, who exhorted the Genevese
to reform, and censuring the vices of the
catholic clergy generally, as well as their
bishops in particular, was betrayed by false
friends to the duke of Savoy, whose anger he
had above all excited, by urging an alliance
between Fribourg and Geneva. One of these
friends received for reward his rich priory. He
was two years in prison, and set free and
reinstated in his benefice by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pierre de la
Baume,</span> bishop of Geneva. He by force took
possession of the property of which he had
been deprived in Savoy, which, notwithstanding
his affection for Geneva, was his country.
The duke besieged him in his château of Cartigny,
which, unable to defend long, he was
forced to fly from, and saw himself almost
wholly deprived of his revenues. The town of
Geneva granted him a pension, and sustained
him in his adversity; and the irritated duke,
desirous only of obtaining possession of his
person, granted him a safe-conduct with a view
to lure him on his territory. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonnivard</span>,
expecting no treachery, profited by the circumstance
to visit his mother, sick and old, at
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Seyssel</span>; and intending to go thence to Lausanne,
he was seized on the Jura, and dragged
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_7' id='Page_7'>7</a></span>
to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chillon</span>. The first two years of his detention
he passed in comparative liberty; but
Charles the Third visiting the castle, he was
cast, by his order, into the vault below the
level of the lake, where are</p>
<div class='c011'><span class='small'>“The seven pillars of Gothic mould.”</span></div>
<p class='c012' >The first column has a story of its own, for a
wall of separation, now thrown down, divided
it and a space of twelve feet square from the
prior’s prison, forming one which enclosed a
young man, his companion. On the walls are a
few figures, in the costume of the time, rude but
spirited sketches, the work of his long leisure;
they are fresh still. Attached to the pillar is
the portion of the broken ring which held his
chain, and an iron bar of his loophole was
sawed through, to allow room for the passage
of a human body. Long toil, and the use of
some instrument left him inadvertently,
severed the fetters and opened the path; but
he reckoned on his powers of swimming, forgetting
they were paralyzed by the space and
air of a dungeon—he plunged into the lake,
and rose no more alive. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonnivard</span> was
delivered two months later; it was in March,
1536. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chillon</span> remained the last possession
of Savoy in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pays de Vaud</span>. Confiding in
its strength, her garrison’s boats insulted all
who were not subjects of Duke Charles, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_8' id='Page_8'>8</a></span>
haughtily rejected the truce proposed to the
Bernese by the emperor’s ambassador. The
Bernese army besieged it on the land side; the
troops and artillery of Geneva armed barks on
the lake; the garrison was forced to surrender,
and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonnivard</span> set free. His pillar, retaining
its iron ring, is the second in order; the floor
of rock round, worn by the uneasy pacing of four
years: on the column, among more perishing
names, is that of Byron. I noticed that of Alexander
Dumas, so high above, that to engrave
its enormous letters he must have mounted a
ladder. The space on either side the range
of columns which support the roof’s groined
arches, forms a sombre aisle, the inner wall left
as nature made it, irregular masses of living
rock; that towards the lake intersected with
a few narrow loopholes high from the ground,
which are rather slits in the stone, so small that
in the morning it is a dark vault, and only when
the beams shine low they come “creeping over
the floor.” At sunset, however, “the imprisoned
ray” is not “dull:” for, as if it acquired
force from its concentration, it falls like a streak
of fire on the pillars and blocks of stone. As we
saw it, the effect was splendid, but partial, as at
the extreme end an artist was sketching by
the light of candles, being otherwise in perfect
obscurity. It is to carry his materials that the
young Swiss, whom we saw as we passed again,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_9' id='Page_9'>9</a></span>
comes daily. Last summer, an amateur, an
English gentleman, visited <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chillon</span> with the
intention of painting not only the dungeon,
but <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonnivard</span>! for this purpose he chose a
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gendarme</span> of spare habit, having a long beard
and sallow face, chained him to the pillar, and
commenced his work, saying, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vous bon Bonnivard</span>.”
He could not, as you may suppose
from the specimen, explain himself in French;
but <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur Chéri</span> (a strange name for a
captive prior) understood his signs made with
money, and submitted with fortitude to lie
robed and fettered on the rocky floor. One
day, unfortunately, a feeling of pity came over
his comrade in the court-yard above, and he
descended to relieve him, thinking to divide
the duty, and that one might do as well as the
other, seeing both were <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gendarmes</span>. The new
comer was a healthy, very young man, stout
and beardless, unlike the studious prior, who
had eaten black bread in small quantities, and
probably abstained from shaving six years.
The pallid <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gendarme</span> feeling, like him he
represented, the blessing of freedom, sprang up
in delight; and the amateur, in despair, when
the fat man assumed the chain, could only hold
his first prisoner fast, stamp his foot and shake
his head at the other, and repeat all the French
he knew, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lui, bon Bonnivard, rester; vous
aller, pas bon Bonnivard</span>!” He grew at last
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_10' id='Page_10'>10</a></span>
so angry that my conductress, who had, she
said, almost expired with laughter, interfered,
and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chéri</span> once more cast himself at the foot
of his pillar. As we went out, she mentioned
the circumstance of having two English ladies
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en pension.</span>”</p>

<p class='c010' >D—— looked up in intense delight, the
horses were in a good stable, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gendarmes</span>
would make admirable grooms. Our best fare
might be fresh eggs, it was true, but what
signified our dinner compared with the advantages
of a view of the lake, with the “Isle’s
tall trees;” of walking from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">oubliettes</span> to
the torture chamber, and resting under the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">potence,</span> and in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonnivard’s</span> dungeon, a lodging
of three chambers, looking on the lake,
which we should hear “ripple night and day.”
We told her we would come in the spring,
when we should have repassed the mountains,
and she looked rather surprised and very
much pleased at the sudden wandering of our
senses.</p>

<p class='c010' >Arrived at the stable, we were confirmed in
our resolve, by seeing the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gendarmes</span> obeying
orders; one holding a horse’s head, another
shaking a bough, in the places where we had
left them, like the warriors in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Belle au
Bois dormant.</span> As I mounted Fanny, the
châtelaine asked permission to touch my hand,
and unaccustomed, I suppose, to see ladies on
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_11' id='Page_11'>11</a></span>
horseback, said it would be “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amusant</span>” to
have us there; so we rode away.</p>

<p class='c010' >Arrived on the brow of the hill, we looked
down on the romantic castle, and my eye
lighted on the chapel roof. “Dear me,” said
I, looking at D——, “the powder magazine!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Humph,” said D——, looking down in
turn.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Is there any danger?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“There might be;” and thereupon we both
commenced enumerating all our memories
held of powder mishaps; till at last I began
to think I might fear to order dinner, from
dread of some mischance in the chimney, and
to ride Fanny, lest her shoes should strike fire
against the stones of the court-yard. We talked
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour</span></i> and the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">contre</span></i> the whole way, and
arrived at the most perfect indecision.</p>

<p class='c010' >We had a splendid view of a stormy sunset,
of golden lake and blackening mountains, and
when we reached <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vevay</span>, night had completely
closed, and we, who had never seen the road
till that afternoon, were puzzled. Fanny was
not so; she assumed her wisest manner, wound
through the crooked streets, and stopped at
the stable of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Trois Couronnes.</span></p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>17th.</span></div>

<p class='c010' >Rain all day, detaining us within doors;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_12' id='Page_12'>12</a></span>
we hope to leave the 20th for Berne and
Fribourg.</p>

<p class='c010' >We walked this evening up the steep road
which leads to the church of St. Martin, as
its terrace has a view no one should fail to
see before quitting <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vevay</span>. The church is
simple and pretty, of the thirteenth century.
Ludlow’s monument, raised by his widow, is
within it, built against the wall; Broughton’s
tombstone forms part of the pavement near.
The former’s memoirs, in which he so prides
himself on his crime as regicide, were first
published at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vevay</span>, where he lived under the
protection of the magistrates of Berne.</p>

<p class='c010' >When William the Third ascended the
throne, he returned to England, and to London,
but finding it possible that he might still be
held there in the light of an assassin, he
thought it more prudent to return to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vevay</span>.
He was seventy-three when he died; his house
is still shown, and the inscription he engraved
above its doorway,</p>
<div class='c011'><span class='small'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omne solum forti patria,</span>”</span></div>
<p class='c013' >was effaced but a short time since.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>18th August.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >We left <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vevay</span> late, taking the road which
passes through <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bulle</span> to Fribourg, being counselled
against that by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Romont.</span> Even this is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_13' id='Page_13'>13</a></span>
far from a good one for horses, being for a
considerable distance a painful succession of
hills, paved and steep, but from which the
views are beautiful, back to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vevay</span> and the
lake, and down the precipices to the valley,
where the Vevayse flows between deep and
wild banks.</p>

<p class='c010' >Arrived at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Châtel St. Denis,</span> with its
old castle on the mound, we could observe the
contrast between the Protestant and Catholic
cantons, even between the habitations which
lie on either side the frontier, scarce a stone’s
throw apart. This is the first village of the
canton Fribourg, and for the first time we saw
heaps of manure piled before the cottage
doors, with the tame pig rooting in them. As
it was a holiday, the peasants who passed us
were in their gayest costume, the men with
their full coloured waistcoat sleeves, the young
girls with their hair braided across their brows,
and the black riband dividing it from the enormous
mass behind, for they wear their own
tresses plaited over a foundation of wool, which
gives them an unnatural bulk; but as they
are commonly fresh and good-looking, not absolutely
unbecoming. A few ancient ladies,
dressed after this fashion, looked far less well.
With all this attention to toilette, the poverty
and dirt of the dwellings whence they issued
was melancholy. They have here a character
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_14' id='Page_14'>14</a></span>
more entirely Swiss, as the lodging of the family
and the cow stable are under the same roof,
and the warmth of the cattle being necessary
to the poor, to whom it often supplies the
place of fuel, only the richer proprietors run
a partition between. It is seldom that even
the first few feet from the ground are built in
stone. Fire, when it occurs, is awfully destructive,
their roofs, chimneys, and walls all wood,
and that intended for fuel piled against the
planks outside, probably for the sake of
warmth, as the wind whistles through every
cranny.</p>

<p class='c010' >The plain which extends from the top of the
long hill to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bulle</span> is covered with rich pasture,
stretching thence up the mountains, and dotted
with chalets.</p>

<p class='c010' >It is a most picturesque town; the old brick
building, with its high tower, and small turrets
with pointed roofs, is the castle of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bulle</span>, now
the prefet’s residence. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cheval Blanc,</span>
where we stopped, is a good inn, and the view
from the windows lovely, even in Switzerland.
There was nearly opposite, a little to the left,
the castle tower and its heavy walls, gilded by
the sunset,—the road below, which wound on
towards <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gruyères</span>; its cottages with their
galleries and jutting roofs, and outside stair,
advancing or retreating on either side, and
between green trees, their background a mountain
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_15' id='Page_15'>15</a></span>
range, whose pine forests were blue in the
distance; beyond a copse in the plain, (shining
in the sun also,) the town and ancient castle of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gruyères</span> crowned one hill to the right; a
second rose abruptly behind it, wooded and in
shadow; and stretching darkly and far away
behind and beyond them, the mountains, which
peak above peak shut in the valley of the
Simmenthal.</p>

<p class='c010' >While D—— was employed in superintending
the evening comforts of Grizzle and Fanny,
the good-natured <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fille d’auberge</span> was my guide
through the streets to the chapel of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capucin</span>
convent, which has a strange altar, I
think of gilt crockery, and a pulpit whose
effect is peculiarly horrid, as out from it projects
a solitary arm, in a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capucin</span> sleeve, whose
bony fingers hold a crucifix.</p>

<p class='c010' >While our dinner was preparing, for nine
o’clock to-night, (those who ride a journey
keeping irregular hours,) D—— and myself
strolled towards <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gruyères</span>, along the winding
road as far as the wooden bridge which crosses
the torrent of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Trême</span>, near the tower which
bears the same name, and was an outpost of
the lords of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gruyères</span>. The castle is interesting
from its age and extraordinary preservation.</p>

<p class='c010' >The precise origin of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes de Gruyères</span>
is unknown; but <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Müller</span> says they were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_16' id='Page_16'>16</a></span>
rich and powerful even in the eleventh century.
The mountain which rises behind the
castle is called La Tine, and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saarine</span> foams
and roars among the dark pines of its defiles.
Its early possessors depended for their revenues
on agriculture only; their wars were with the
wolves, and their proudest conquests the cultivation
of a desert. The younger branches
of their house owned as their inheritance the
forest-castle of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Salvans,</span> and a few mountain
pastures: they lived in company of their
knights among their herdsmen, and with a simplicity
resembling theirs; and from the height
on which their <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">château of Œx</span> still stands
watched over and protected their vassals.</p>

<p class='c010' >After the battle of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Laupen,</span> and when peace
had ensued, the counts, impoverished by the
wars, were constrained by their need to part
with various rights and privileges. In 1341
Count Pierre mortgaged for ten years to the
inhabitants of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gruyères</span> the duties they were
wont to pay on each head of cattle, those on
forage, cheese, and butter, and also the receipt
of the fines paid for crimes perpetrated in the
forest. Three times at this period did Berne
revive the feud with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gruyères</span>.</p>

<p class='c010' >The Count Pierre above-mentioned, deceased,
left the administration in the hands of
a namesake, whose connexions in the Simmenthal
rendered him sufficiently powerful there
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_17' id='Page_17'>17</a></span>
to manifest the old hatred of his house to the
seigneur of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Weissenburg,</span> citizen of Berne.
The greater part of the Simmenthal was under
the count’s protection; but many of its farms
and châteaux belonged to the lords of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Weissenburg</span>
and others, having been built by their
ancestry. Count Pierre of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gruyères</span> marched
against <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Weissenburg;</span> Banneret Peter Wendschaz
commanded the Bernese against him.
At that spot of the Simmenthal there are
heights which narrow the passage, and the
Bernese, who had strayed to plunder cattle,
received a sore punishment for their lack of
foresight. The banneret himself, fighting
with the courage of despair, surrounded and
overpowered, collected his failing strength for
a last effort, hurled the banner of the republic
above the heads of his assailants, and died
consoled, because it was unprofaned by the
touch of a conqueror: the Bernese mournfully
bore it within their walls.</p>

<p class='c010' >The peasants of the Simmenthal enacted
laws for their own territory; that on fines
showing a chivalrous spirit which did them
honour. As it was presumed that the offended
might defend himself against a blow, the
offender was fined one <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">livre</span> only; the man
who uttered abuse was fined four, and he who
falsely gave the lie in a judge’s presence, ten
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_18' id='Page_18'>18</a></span>
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">livres</span>, since it was considered most difficult
to guard against slander and calumny.</p>

<p class='c010' >Required by their allies of Fribourg to
march with them against the sire of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Grumingen,</span>
vassal of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gruyères</span>, the Bernese gladly
answered to the call, and seized on his castle,
though he sued for peace. The count and
his knightly companions were wont to pursue
their chivalrous sports on the green meadows
which stretch beneath the castle. The count’s
attendants had dispersed themselves in a wood
not far distant, and in the copses which surround
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tour de Trême,</span> when the men of
Berne and Fribourg, with a force superior to
his own, surprised the count himself in the
oak-tree meadow. Pierre fought with the
heroism of his antique race, but the numbers
had well nigh overpowered him, when two of
his vassals, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Clarembold</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ulric Bras de fer,</span>
resolved to save him at all hazards, flung
themselves before his person, favoured his retreat,
and guarding the narrow defile through
which he had passed, kept his enemies at bay,
till the count, who had hastily sounded his
war-note and gathered his scattered troop,
spurred back to the charge, put the assailants
to the rout, and many of them to the sword.
To <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Clarembold</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bras de fer,</span> who covered
with blood hailed his reappearance and joined
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_19' id='Page_19'>19</a></span>
in his attack, he accorded privileges and franchises,
which he extended to their posterity.
Their memories are still honoured in their
village of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Villars sous Monts.</span></p>

<p class='c010' >Soon after this, in 1349, ushered in by fearful
earthquakes, broke out the plague described
by Boccaccio, which desolated Europe
and Asia. According to the general belief, a
third of the population of Switzerland died;
the churchyards were filled to overflowing, and
the victims buried in unconsecrated ground,
and without religious rites, which priests were
wanting to perform; whole regions were left
desert, and lordships abandoned and unclaimed
by friend or foe. Struck with terror, men
strove to avert the scourge by the various and
horrid means prompted by fear and fanaticism.
It was then that numerous travelling societies,
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Flagellans</span>, wandered from canton to canton,
inflicting blows and torment on themselves,
for the sins of the world. Where they
passed, the excited people devoted to death a
number of Jews, innocent of all crime; it is
well known that at Kybourg, the more enlightened
Duke Albert was forced against his
will to deliver three hundred to the flames;
that at Bâle they were all driven into a wooden
house, and burned with it; while at Constance
and at <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Eslingen,</span> in the synagogue, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'>20</a></span>
despairing people inflicted death on themselves.</p>

<p class='c010' >The vassals of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gruyères</span>, unflinching in
battle, attached and faithful to their lords,
had obtained from them so many and important
privileges, either as reward for their services,
or in barter for the sums of money their
necessities demanded, as to become almost as
free as the most democratic states of Switzerland.
But for their insatiable ambition, the
counts of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gruyères</span> might have been the happiest
of mortals; but they looked from their tall
towers on the height, less to rejoice in their
possessions than to mourn that they saw
their boundary. Not being kings themselves,
they strove to find consolation in rendering
themselves necessary to royalty; and
they led their vassals from their flocks, and
mountain pastures, and calm homes, to fight
in foreign quarrels, and in climates so different
from their own, that those sunk victims to
the change who had been spared by the sword.</p>

<p class='c010' >Count Michel of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gruyères</span>, who died in
1570, was the last of his line. He was one of
that brotherhood of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Cuiller,</span> who quitted
their own lands to ravage those of Geneva.
He had commanded their army, forced many
of his vassals to serve under their banner;
and also sold yearly, and for several years,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_21' id='Page_21'>21</a></span>
five hundred men to the French armies in
Italy. They had rendered good service to the
king of France, but Henry the Second, under
various pretences, refused to pay the immense
sums he owed to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gruyères</span>; and Michel saw
his country depopulated in vain, his debts
accumulating, though he had received a large
loan from his neighbours and sold his subjects
a portion of his lordly privilege, till at last,
persecuted by his creditors, and notwithstanding
his carelessness of their welfare, mourned
by his devoted vassals, he abandoned the
inheritance of his fathers, which he saw before
his eyes divided between the two cantons,
and concealed his shame and sorrow in the
castle of a relative in Burgundy, where he
died poor and without an heir.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>19th August.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >So unwell this morning as to fear durance
vile at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cheval Blanc,</span> but, being determined
to go if possible, set off at three. I
had hoped our road lay beneath <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gruyères</span>,
but it led through the streets of the town, and
thence for a considerable distance across rich
meadows, their green pastures spotted with
chalets; farther on they are divided by pine
forests, the road skirting or passing through
them, the sunshine reposing on their verdant
glades, or playing among their old trunks,
or excluded where these have been felled and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_22' id='Page_22'>22</a></span>
supplied by multitudes of young stems crowded
in nature’s extravagance. The hedges were
gay with wild pinks and woodbine, and on the
sides of the road were strips of green and
rivulets for Fanny’s feet. We left on the
right a gorge, through which the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saarine</span>
flows, commanded by a noble looking ruin.
The peasantry here are almost German, and
therefore perhaps a milder and more amiable
race than the French or Genevese. They
issued from their cottages and ran from their
work in the fields to see us pass by, but
always took off their hats and wished good
evening. The clouds had threatened rain,
but the wind, which whistled in the firs, blew
it over us and left only a fine stormy sky
above the mountains, partly hiding their
white heads, while the sun was brilliant in the
valley. As we passed the meadows where the
cows were grazing, and the little cowherd lay
almost hid in the clover, we thought of Lord
Byron’s praise of the bells; their tones,
differing and harmonizing, tinkled sweet music.
Nearer Fribourg is a fair view into the gorge
from the road, which hangs over it where a
sweep of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saarine</span> makes almost an island
of a tract of pine grove, and a suspension
bridge has been flung from the peninsula to
the shore. An avenue of fine trees leads into
Fribourg, of which the first view with its dim
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_23' id='Page_23'>23</a></span>
mountains and most golden valley, is more
striking than that of any town I have seen
as yet, from the magnitude of the mighty
chasm, over whose very edge the houses seem
to hang giddily high above the torrent, and the
feudal watch-towers, which guarded once, and
are still ranged along the winding of its opposite
shore. The far famed bridge was not visible,
but we could see that now in progress, crossing
the gorge of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gotteron</span>, which issues from
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saarine</span>. In its present and unfinished
state it hangs in an awful curve over the
abyss, like a thread for a fairy rope-dancer.</p>

<p class='c010' >The avenue passed, the road becomes precipitous,
and scarcely, on a dark night, safe
we crossed a bridge, and rode beneath an
ancient gate to enter the old town. The
houses which line the streets, narrow and ill-paved,
are curious and of great age, as are
the quaint fountains; at the summit of whose
gilt and painted columns figure grotesque
saints and Virgins. After various windings
we reached this hotel, the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zahringerhof,</span> which
should be chosen for its situation and view,
as it is close to the bridge and built on the
very edge of the chasm.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>20th August.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Stayed at Fribourg, a cold day broken by
hail-storms, and passed it in walking over the
town and along the narrow valley of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_24' id='Page_24'>24</a></span>
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gotteron</span>. Not far from the hôtel on the
Place, and opposite the town hall, which is
built on the site of the palace of Duke Berthhold,
is the venerable lime-tree, planted, according
to tradition, the 22nd June, 1476, the
day of the battle of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Morat</span>.</p>

<p class='c010' >The young soldier who brought the tidings
was a native of Fribourg; he had been wounded
in the conflict, and feeling he grew weaker as
he approached the town from fatigue and loss
of blood, and that his shout of victory waxed
too feeble to be heard, he gathered a bough
as he passed, and waved it over his head in
token of rejoicing. Arrived at this place,
where the townsmen were assembled, he faltered
forth his news and sunk down to die.
They planted on the very spot his lime-tree
branch, and it lived and grew his monument,
and is now so old, that the decaying branches
are rested on the four stone pillars and wooden
trellis-work which surround it; there is an express
order to tie no animal near, but it is
dying of extreme age, and will hardly outlive
another winter.</p>

<p class='c010' >Berthhold, duke of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zahringen,</span> was imperial
governor of Zurich, landgrave of Burgundy,
and lieutentant of Œchtland and Lausanne.
By his command ancient villages were surrounded
by walls and free towns built, behind
whose fortifications the peasants of the empire,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_25' id='Page_25'>25</a></span>
who united themselves to the inhabitants, might
rest in peace and security. The love of change,
the hope of gain, but above all of liberty,
quiet, and order, aided in peopling these towns.
The duke, as hereditary governor, and because
the high roads and bridges were everywhere
property of the feudal lord, taxed each
house, and levied a duty on all merchandise;
and also, when a subject died without heirs,
inherited a third of his possessions. The
citizens were tried by twelve or twenty-four of
their own body, presided, over by an “avoyer”
elected yearly, and sentence pronounced in
accordance with the facts proved by a sufficient
number of witnesses. Each townsman
was, during his life, master of his own property,
and it fell to his widow in case of his
demise. The whole town took care of the
orphans. The feudal lord could neither force
a man to become a citizen, nor prevent an inhabitant
of his town from departing if so
pleased him; but freemen and serfs sought
therefore the more willingly within it a safeguard
from the dangers consequent on dispersion;
and the serfs were considered free
if during the first year their master failed to
claim them and prove their servitude by the
affirmation of seven relatives. When the lord
of the city required their presence, they were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_26' id='Page_26'>26</a></span>
bound only to journey to a distance whence
they might return to sleep in their own homes.</p>

<p class='c010' >In the year 1178, Berthhold the Fourth,
whose father and uncle had set the example
of encouraging these establishments, chose the
village built along the precipices of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saarine</span>, and founded his town of Fribourg
partly on a territory belonging to the abbey
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Payerne,</span> but mostly on his own land, and
with the aid and counsel of various barons. It
became inhabited; boasting freedom, but certainly
not equality, for the nobles, as yet unused
to citizenship, kept the line of demarcation
so strongly marked as even to fix on a
separate place of burial, and, in consequence
of this, six hundred years passed without so
confounding distinctions, as to give one language
to the town on the shore, and that on
the crags above it—German being the dialect
most in use among the inhabitants of the
former, while their fellow-citizens spoke French
only. This is no longer the case, but in 1794,
when <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Müller</span> wrote, many who lived in the
one spot were unintelligible to the other.</p>

<p class='c010' >Taking one of the steep streets, which is
paved in steps as a stair, we walked to the
massy roofed wooden bridge, across which the
diligence to Berne travelled before the new
one was built, the descent and ascent occupying
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_27' id='Page_27'>27</a></span>
about an hour. From between its heavy
wooden work you have a good view of the
suspension bridge, 174 feet above the bed of
the torrent, and which, though so much longer
than the Menai, for its length is 905 feet,
appears of so much lighter construction;
from this spot the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zahringen</span> hôtel seems a
real castle in the air. We crossed the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saarine</span>,
and turned to the left, and under an old archway
of Duke Berthhold’s time, which forms
the entrance to the gorge of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gotteron</span>.
It is a lonely and beautiful glen, sunk deep
between wooded crags which barely allow
room for a path way beside the stream, which
bounds brightly on, flashing in the sun, while
it turns the heavy wheels of rustic mills, as if
glad of its own usefulness; and farther, where
the valley is less narrow, winding through the
small green meadow, and among the picturesque
wooden cottages, as if seeking repose
near those it has toiled for. In the spring,
the quiet river becomes at times a destructive
torrent, uprooting tree and dwelling. About
Fribourg cretinism exists, and among the elder
peasantry the goitre is common—we saw in
the glen one poor idiot, who howled and
gibbered as we went by.</p>

<p class='c010' >Dined in company of a French family—the
elder hope just issued from the Jesuits’ college,
a disagreeable specimen of their training,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_28' id='Page_28'>28</a></span>
with large black hands and unpleasant
habits. In the evening went to the cathedral,
which in itself is only gaudy, but whose organ
and organ player are most wonderful. Listening
to the higher tones, it was difficult to persuade
myself that I did not hear a chorus of
sweet voices, and its “storm” did not resemble
an earthly instrument touched by a mortal
hand; it was like “nothing but thunder,” and
solemn and awful, as it rolled along the aisle’s
dusk in the evening.</p>

<p class='c009' >Left Fribourg for Berne, and was disappointed
in the road, which presents a long
series of endless hills, and (as heavy clouds,
which brought us several hail-storms, hid the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_30' id='Page_30'>30</a></span>
white mountains) less interesting than those
hitherto travelled.</p>

<p class='c010' >At the limit of the cantons of Berne and
Fribourg, where the river Sense separates
them, the country is wooded and beautiful,
but of a mild character and resembling England.
The name of the village is <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Neunneck;</span>
and here, on the 5th of March, 1798, the same
day on which Berne surrendered to another
column of the French army, two thousand
Swiss, commanded by Colonel de <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Grafenried,</span>
defeated the French, drove them across the
Sense, killed or wounded fifteen hundred of
their men, and took eighteen pieces of cannon.
They made no prisoners, but marched up the
mountain with fixed bayonets, and forced the
enemy from all his positions. They lost
themselves 173 soldiers, and great numbers
were wounded.</p>

<p class='c010' >We exchanged here the seeming poverty of
the canton Fribourg for the air of happiness
and riches peculiar to this. The peasantry
appear a civil and kindly race. The females
wear dark dresses and black velvet caps, whose
broad wired lace worn far back from their
sunburnt faces looks like the outspread
wings of a hornet. The entrance to Berne is
not on this side (that of the plain) striking.
A long avenue leads to a handsome gate
flanked by two modern bears; for the bear is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_31' id='Page_31'>31</a></span>
omnipresent. Armed cap-a-pie on the column
of one fountain, on another standing as esquire
beside the figure of Duke Berthhold, forming
a procession on the clock-tower, which in his
time guarded the outer wall, marking in effigy
the butler at the inn, and in <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">propria persona</span></i>
inhabiting the town ditch outside the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Aarberg</span>
gate, where four of the fraternity live on
(alas!) diminished revenues, for the property
bequeathed them towards the close of the last
century by a bear-loving old lady, and which,
it is said, had accumulated to 70 millions of
francs, was seized by the French in ’98, and
with the remainder of the town-treasure, and
the bears themselves led away captives, were
transported to Paris. In insult to the conquered,
the animals received fresh names, and
the new one of each was inscribed on his
travelling caravan, being that of a <em>magistrate</em>
of Berne!</p>

<p class='c010' >It was in 1191, when the great barons of the
Alps and the most powerful lords of Burgundy
leagued their forces against Berthhold
the Fifth, lieutenant of the empire, either, historians
say, in hatred of his equitable administration,
or in jealousy of his still increasing
sway, that he inclosed as small towns various
villages for his own and his vassals’ security;
and seeking out another spot under the protection
of the imperial franchise, equally
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_32' id='Page_32'>32</a></span>
distant from all his enemies, and unsuspected
by his partizans, he chose a hamlet called
Berne, built on a peninsula formed by the
rapid Aar, when it rushes from the lake of
Thun; and, about a month after he had defeated
the leagued lords in one of the high
valleys, surrounded it with a ditch and walls.
Many knights and nobles took up their residence
there; among the rest, Rodolph of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Erlach,</span>
of an ancient Burgundian house, and
whose descendants have seven times given
chiefs to the republic, and twice saved Berne
from ruin. The laws were similar to those of
Fribourg.</p>

<p class='c010' >In 1338, the year in which the emperor
Louis of Bavaria convoked the diet of Frankfort
to discuss the affair of his excommunication,
147 years after the foundation of Berne,
when she had no protector and few allies, the
counts and barons of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Œchtland, Aargau,</span> and
Burgundy, urged on by the emperor, projected
her destruction. The lords of the
house of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Neuchâtel,</span> the counts of Kibourg,
and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pierre of Gruyères</span> and others, assembled
in the castle of Nidau, whither, notwithstanding
her alliance with Berne, came ambassadors
from Fribourg, to say that the injuries they
all suffered had a common origin, that Berne
strove to level the nobles to the condition of
the populace, and it being vain to essay by
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_33' id='Page_33'>33</a></span>
partial attacks to set bounds to her audacity,
it would be well that united forces should
raze her city to the ground.</p>

<p class='c010' >Berne acted nobly and calmly—she besought
no foreign protection, but said, in a
conference which took place between her delegates
and the feudal lords, that “to peace she
would sacrifice all save justice.” She summoned
Fribourg to a diet held at <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Blamatt,</span> reckoning
on the memory of their common founder and
long friendship; but her deputies received no
token of peace or amity, and Berne felt she
was abandoned. During this time, 700 lords
with the coronet on their <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">casques,</span> 1200 armed
knights, 3000 horsemen, and more than 15,000
foot, were gathering against Berne.</p>

<p class='c010' ><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Laupen,</span> which is also on the Sense, four
miles lower down than <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Neunneck,</span> besieged by
the allies, had demanded and obtained succour
from Berne. The Bernese were themselves
embarrassed in the choice of a general; of
the brave knights and citizens who surrounded
the avoyer of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bubenberg</span>, none esteeming
himself capable of a command on which depended
the fate and liberty of their descendants;
and while they still sate irresolute in
council, Rodolph, knight and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">castellan</span> of
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Erlach,</span> son of Ulrich, under whose command
many still living had conquered the leagued
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_34' id='Page_34'>34</a></span>
nobles at <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Donnerbuhel</span> forty years before, rode
armed into Berne.</p>

<p class='c010' >He was at the same time guardian of the
young count of Nidau and citizen of Berne.
To conciliate his will with the fidelity he owed
his suzerain, he represented to his ward, that
to serve the cause of the nobles against his
fellow-citizens would injure his interests
beyond reparation; and the young count, as in
reply he scornfully bade him join the ranks of
his peers, said, “With two hundred coroneted
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">casques,</span> and a hundred and forty knights
devoted to my banner, it is indifferent to me
to lose a man.”</p>

<p class='c010' ><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Erlach</span> replied coldly, “You have called
me a man, Sir Count; I will prove to you that
I am one.”</p>

<p class='c010' >When he had dismounted and appeared before
the senate, the sight of him reviving the
memory of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Donnerbuhel</span> and his father, he
was named general by acclamation, and the
avoyer placed the banner of the republic in
his hand.</p>

<p class='c010' >As he stood holding it, he addressed the
citizens:</p>

<p class='c010' >“I have fought with you,” he said, “in six
battles, where our numbers were always inferior,
and always victorious. Discipline is a
sure means of conquest, and without it courage
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_35' id='Page_35'>35</a></span>
is of no avail. You, artisans, who are freemen,
and obey unwillingly, you can remain
free only by learning obedience to those to
whom it is due; without absolute authority I
will not be your general. I do not fear the
foe; with God’s aid and yours we will drive
him back, as when you were led by my
father.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The people of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Underwald</span> and
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Soleure</span> were
the sole allies of Berne. Alms were distributed,
solemn vows and processions made,
during the brief time which intervened. One
night, by the light of the moon, the general
gave the troops the signal to depart. They
were in all about six thousand. The women
and children, who remained on the summit of
the walls to watch and to pray, followed them
with their eyes till they could distinguish them
no longer, over the unequal ground and in the
doubtful light. Descending thence they sought,
the poor the churches, their superiors the private
oratories of their mansions, and remained
the livelong day in prayer; while the avoyer
of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bubenberg</span>, and others of the senate’s
oldest members, remained sitting in council,
to provide at all events for the city’s safety.</p>

<p class='c010' >Rodolph of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Erlach</span> led on his troops in the
most perfect order, taking up his position,
about mid-day, at a short distance from
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_36' id='Page_36'>36</a></span>
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Laupen</span> on a height, and flanked by a forest.
Several of the knights of the opposing army,
which was encamped in sight, rode forth from
the ranks to survey the Bernese, and kept up
a conversation of mingled raillery and bravado.</p>

<p class='c010' >The young count of Nidau augured differently
of the result: “I shall lose land and life
to-day,” he said, “but I will sell them
dearly.” In the attack, the rear guard of the
Bernese, composed of inexperienced troops,
was seized with panic, and fled. <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Erlach</span>, to
whom the news came, said gaily, “Victory is
ours, friends; we have lost the clog of
cowards!” and dashing forward, heading the
young men he had assembled round his own
person, the flower of Berne, he broke through
the masses of the enemy’s infantry. Thenceforth
the fortune of the day was no longer
doubtful. The young count of Nidau fell one of
the first, and the Bernese army, returned from
the pursuit, kneeled down to offer up thanksgiving
on the field where it had conquered, and according
to custom passed the night there; the
following morning saw its triumphal return to
Berne.</p>

<p class='c010' ><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Diebold Baselwind,</span> the priest who had
harangued them before the battle, marched
first; behind them were borne the banners and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_37' id='Page_37'>37</a></span>
arms of the fallen, and Rodolph of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Erlach</span>,
contented with reviving his father’s fame in
his own, deposed his sovereign authority.</p>

<p class='c010' >The count of Nidau had left two young
children; and their relatives of the house of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Neuchâtel,</span> too feeble themselves to defend
the lordship, feared with reason to confide it
to a foreign prince. Their conduct speaks
the highest praise of the knight of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Erlach</span>.
They employed the mediation of the bishop
of Basle to pray that he, “whose integrity was
as well known as his valour, would receive as
his charge the orphan boys and the lordship
of Nidau.” He accepted the trust; a peace
was concluded between Nidau and Berne, and
the dead count’s sons, Rodolph and Jacques,
enjoyed undisturbed the inheritance of their
brave father.</p>

<p class='c010' >Time had gone on, and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">castellan</span>
of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Erlach</span>, grown an
aged man, lived at <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Reichenbach</span>,
a solitary spot on the shores of the Aar,
which had also been his father’s residence.
He had two sons, and a daughter married to
the esquire of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Rudenz</span>.</p>

<p class='c010' >One day of the year 1360, when he had employed,
as was his wont, his domestics in his
fields and gardens, and sate in his halls with
no company save his dogs couched on the
floor, and his sword of the battle of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Laupen</span> suspended
from the wall, his son-in-law came to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_38' id='Page_38'>38</a></span>
seek him. He was a dissipated and reckless
man, and as they conversed together, high
words ensued on the subject of Margaret’s
marriage portion. The knight was white-headed
and feeble; and as he reprimanded
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Rudenz</span> with dignity and gravity, his son-in-law
started from his seat, seized the sword
which hung near him, and plunged it into the
old man’s heart.</p>

<p class='c010' >The howling dogs pursued him to the forest,
whither he fled, and when the news got wind,
there was neither noble nor citizen who did not
rise in arms to pursue the parricide. He
died shortly, but in what manner is not
known.</p>

<p class='c010' >This is a long digression, but the ride
through the sombre streets of the old town
calls to mind the man who was named its irreproachable
hero. The date of the most ancient
mansions now standing is of 1405, as in
that year the entire city then existing was
destroyed by fire, saving, however, the three
massive towers, that of Duke Berthhold, the
prison, and Christopher’s tower, in the principal
street of Berne.</p>

<p class='c010' >The town has a gloomy aspect, with its low
arcades resting on heavy masonry. The streets
have a deep dangerous <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ruisseau</span> flowing down
their centre, bound by stone. I feared that
my starting Fanny might break a leg, by
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_39' id='Page_39'>39</a></span>
slipping down. We rode to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Faucon,</span>
which has, I believe deservedly, the reputation
of being one of the best inns in Switzerland;
but we had left Fribourg late, and lingered on
the way, and consequently found it full. The
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Couronne</span> was a bad substitute; the house is
three hundred years old, and has objections
attendant on its worm-eaten wood and dirty
old age, which I advise you to avoid; the
more so as its master is the first Swiss I have
seen who unites incivility with high charges.
We paid the strangers’ homage to the citizen
bears, who are comfortably lodged without the
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Aarberg</span> gate. The largest received our visit
in his bath, a stone bason, into which he
waddled on our approach, and remained while
we stayed, staring hungrily at us, up to his
neck in water.</p>

<p class='c010' >From the bears we walked to the cathedral,
which stands on the terrace above the Aar,
looking down on the range of aristocratic buildings
which skirt it, their possessors’ coats of
arms sculptured over their portals, and their
gardens sloping to the water, and on the
range of Bernese Alps, rising grandly in the
distance, but half hidden to-day by the heavy
clouds.</p>

<p class='c010' >This shady platform is raised one hundred
and eight feet above the Aar, yet
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_40' id='Page_40'>40</a></span>
into its wall was inserted a marble slab,
recalling a singular accident on the 25th of
July, 1654. A young student, amusing himself
with his companions, vaulted on a horse which
was quietly feeding under the trees, and being
a spirited animal, started violently away, and,
terrified by the shouts of Weinzapfli’s comrades,
sprang with him over the low parapet.
The horse was killed on the spot, but the student,
who fell in soft garden ground, and only
broke his arms and legs, recovered, and became
a pastor.</p>

<p class='c010' >The minster is a fine Gothic building, and
was commenced, in 1420, by the son of the
architect who built the famous tower of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Strasburg.</span></p>

<p class='c010' >The monument, surrounded by gaudy armorial
bearings, was raised by the town to
Duke Berthhold the Fifth, in 1600. He was the
last of the line of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zæringen,</span> for he had been
left a widower early, with two young sons,
and contracted a second marriage with a
countess of Kibourg. Either to ensure the
inheritance to her own future offspring, or
won by the jealous nobles to be their accomplice,
this fury in human shape poisoned
the two children of her husband. Her guilt
once proved to him, neither the tenderness he
had once felt for her, nor the thought that by
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_41' id='Page_41'>41</a></span>
accusing one so nearly allied he tarnished the
glory of his house, could arrest the outburst of
his paternal agony. In the year 1217 she perished
by the hands of the executioner; and
Duke Berthhold, unwilling to form another
alliance after one so fatal, felt it a consolation
that in his person would close the misfortunes
of his house.</p>

<p class='c010' >Occupying a place in the aisle opposite that
which contains Duke Berthhold’s monument,
is a long catalogue of names inscribed on
marble tablets; those of the brave men
who fell in 1798, vainly resisting foreign invasion.</p>

<p class='c010' >The saddest fate was that of Charles Louis
of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Erlach</span>, a man who, like his ancestors, had
deserved the esteem and love of his fellow-citizens.
Before the revolution he had served
France, and was named field-marshal at the
moment of the French invasion in 1798. He
had hurried to his native town, and, like his
great predecessor, been named by acclamation
general of the forces; but the then existing
government was timid and irresolute. Accompanied
by eighty of his officers, like himself
members of the council, he presented himself
before it the 24th of February, and, by his
energy and arguments, revived its hopes and
raised its courage. He was endowed with full
powers to act as he should see fit as soon as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_42' id='Page_42'>42</a></span>
the yet unconcluded truce should expire. He
left the city to decide on the measures to be
taken, but, even as the moment for their execution
arrived, received the order to suspend
hostilities. The government had abdicated
its powers. Marshal <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Brune’s</span> policy had sown
division in the senate as well as among the
troops. Berne yielded almost without resistance;
and <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Erlach’s</span> soldiers, blinded by suspicions
artfully instilled, and maddened by
despair, massacred him in the village of
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wichdorff.</span></p>

<p class='c010' >The treasure of the republic, accumulated
through so many generations, was seized on
by Marshal <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Brune</span> without even the formality
of an inventory taken. The Directory, informed
of the omission, and in a case of this
sort placing little confidence in its general,
despatched a courier extraordinary with positive
orders that it should be repaired.</p>

<p class='c010' >A kind of list was in consequence hastily
made by the marshal s command, and himself
wrote to the Directory—</p>

<p class='c010' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vous verrez par l’état, dont je vous envoie
copie, que les sommes trouvées dans le
trésor cadrent <em>à peu près</em> avec les régistres.</span>”</p>

<p class='c010' >The most moderate calculation, for into it
private losses and depredations cannot enter,
computes the losses of Berne (city and canton)
at forty-two millions of francs. It was asserted
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_43' id='Page_43'>43</a></span>
that of this <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Brune</span> had appropriated to himself
the golden medals of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel de Ville,</span>
twenty-two carriages, and above three hundred
thousand francs in specie!! This treatment of
Berne followed close on assurances of support
and amity, for while the marshal’s forces were
yet unassembled, and before <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schaumbourg’s</span>
reinforcement had arrived, France, through
her commissary, declared that she desired her
neighbour’s freedom and happiness only, and
that, as soon as a government sufficiently
democratic should be established, the independence
of Berne would be respected, and
the French army withdrawn.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>23rd August, Thun.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Left the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Couronne</span> with its discomfort and
dirty stables. A steep descent leads to the
bridge, beyond which run at right angles the
two roads, one leading hither, the other to
Zurich, beneath noble avenues. We had a
lovely day and ride through a happy looking
country, wood, pasture and mountain, and
passed through a village, where the laugh of
all the lookers-on from the windows saluted
me as I rode Fanny in and through a clear
pond, far deeper than I thought, but out of
which we got to our honour.</p>

<p class='c010' >Approaching Thun, the country is romantic
and most beautiful. It was a warm fine evening,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_44' id='Page_44'>44</a></span>
and the old dark castle, now a prison, on
the height, with its peaked roof and four towers
flanking it, and the church by its side, stood
out from a bright sky.</p>

<p class='c010' >The Aar, which issues from the lake about
a mile further, winds below, rapid and blue as
the Rhone. We crossed it on a covered wooden
bridge, and skirted the town, passing ancient
gates and massive towers, and the once fortified
wall, to arrive hither.</p>

<p class='c010' >The Pension <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Baumgarten</span> stands on higher
ground than the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel Bellevue,</span> backed by
wooded heights, to the foot of which its park
extends; and the rooms opening on flower-gardens
look on the Aar, winding through
rich meadows, with scattered houses, and a
grey feudal tower on the near shore; and the
Stockhorn, with its strange sharp peak projecting
above; and the massive pyramid of
the Neisen beyond; the wreaths of vapour
floating along the side of the first serving its
forests for pedestal or canopy. On the right
rose the castle; and to the left, far away in
the opening, the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jungfrau</span> and her attendants,
looking with the blush of that sweet evening
on them, I thought even lovelier than Mont
Blanc.</p>

<p class='c010' >The rights of “bourgeoisie” attached to
Thun make poverty almost impossible, and
its inhabitants are therefore less laborious than
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_45' id='Page_45'>45</a></span>
in other parts of Switzerland; each citizen
possessing a right of pasture, building timber,
and firewood, besides a yearly sum of money
drawn from the surplus revenues of their
flourishing and unexpensive country. By a
strangely egotistical rule of the law-makers,
these advantages attach exclusively to the
males, so that a female orphan left unmarried,
or a widow without a son, might find herself
suddenly destitute, and dependent on
strangers’ charity.</p>

<p class='c010' >The service of the English church is performed
every Sunday by an English clergyman
in the Swiss church. No prospect can be
more beautiful than that from the churchyard
of Thun. The wall is built on the very edge
of the precipitous hill it half circles; round
and along it, from distance to distance, are
what elsewhere I should call summer-houses,
open stone edifices, on whose benches the
inhabitants of Thun sit in the shade, enjoying
the glorious and varied views over each side
of the valley. A winding road, passing
beneath an ancient gateway and a stair of
irregular steps, leads up the height on which
the church stands. The castle is but a few
paces from it, on the platform of the same hill:
among its annals is written a bloody tale of
family feud.</p>

<p class='c010' >When the last duke of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zæringen,</span> who had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_46' id='Page_46'>46</a></span>
refused to become an emperor, was interred
in 1218 at St. Pierre in the Black Forest, his
large possessions were divided. Ulric of
Kibourg, his brother-in-law, inherited those
situated in Burgundy; Berne and Zurich
solicited and obtained from the Emperor
Frederic the Second the title of free towns;
and when the news, so long desired, reached
Lausanne of the failing of the line of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zæringen,</span>
(the fall of the founder of Berne twenty-five
years after its foundation,) the Bishop Berthhold
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Neuchâtel</span> convoked together the
chapter, knights, and citizens in the court of the
church of Notre Dame, and, solemnly cursing
the memory of the deceased duke, who had
once made war against him, he gave (solemnly
also) the advowson of the bishopric into the
hands of the Mother of God for ever!!</p>

<p class='c010' >In the year 1332, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hartmann</span>, count of
Kibourg, possessed, with the lordship of Thun
itself, that of various villages surrounding it,
as well on the mountains as on the green plains
through which flows the Aar. Among these
were <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Berthoud</span>,
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Landshut</span>, and other property
of allodial tenure. Thun and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Berthoud</span>,
governed according to the sage customs of
their territory, had extended their limits by
reason of their increasing population. The
avoyers of the count pronounced judgment in
accordance with a municipal code which even
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_47' id='Page_47'>47</a></span>
himself respected. The richest and most
ancient of the nobility thronged his court and
were his brothers in arms. When <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hartmann</span>
of Kibourg died, his widow, the countess Elizabeth,
allowed an overweening influence to
Senn of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Münsigen</span>, a nobleman whose domains
lay in the neighbourhood, and who through her
favour had become director of her councils.
Her sons, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hartmann</span>, heir of Kibourg, and
Eberard, were youths, and the eldest, who
hated his brother, used every means to conciliate
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Münsigen’s</span> favour to himself, and to
prejudice him against Eberard, at that period
studying at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Bologna</span>, the cradle of all science
then existing, at an expense of sixteen marks
yearly. Owing to his brother’s influence, this
remained undefrayed; and, having vainly
besought its payment, Eberard returned to
his paternal castle to claim the portion left
him by his father.</p>

<p class='c010' >His relatives treated his demands with
derision, and himself as a young man who
might indeed possess rights but who knew not
how to uphold them. One night, after a hunting
or hawking party, the brothers had arrived
at the castle of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Landshut</span>, which is some
leagues from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Berthoud</span>, and Eberard, fatigued
with exertion, slept by Hartmann’s side too
soundly to be at first aware of his treason.
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hartmann</span> bound him as he lay, and sent him,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_48' id='Page_48'>48</a></span>
thus secured and half naked, under a strong
guard, to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rochefort</span> in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Neuchâtel,</span> Comte
Rodolph of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Neuchâtel</span> being his wife’s father.
Arrived at his destination, Eberard accepted,
perforce, for arbitrator between their differences
Duke Leopold of Austria. Leopold
pronounced that <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hartmann</span> should remain sole
lord of the entire patrimony; that Eberard
should inhabit the castle of Thun, and of the
two hundred marks he received from his
benefices as canon of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Strasburg</span> and Cologne
yield three parts to his brother to defray the
debts of their house. To this sentence the
prisoner was obliged to subscribe, and all the
nobility of the lordship of Kibourg assembled
by invitation in the castle of Thun to celebrate
the reconciliation of the brothers. As the
defrauded young man sate with them at the
banquet, Count <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hartmann</span> and the favourite,
Senn of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Münsigen</span>, applauded each other unconstrainedly
on the success of their schemes: “Belike,”
said the former, alluding to Eberard’s
inexperience and easiness of belief, “my brother
may need a tutor to teach him to sign our peace.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Eberard had many friends among the guests,
and this and other sarcasms, which reached
their ears, raised their choler, long restrained,—and
some started from the banquet and drew
their swords. A fearful tumult arose instantly.
The furious guests, dividing themselves into two
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_49' id='Page_49'>49</a></span>
parties, rushed madly at each other, and <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hartmann</span>
was killed by chance and in the obscurity
on the steps of the tower stair. It was unknown
whether the instrument of this involuntary
murder was Eberard in person; but at
the moment when the citizens of Thun, who,
attracted by the extraordinary noise, had armed
in haste, rushed up the hill to the castle to
know its cause, the body of Count <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hartmann</span>,
flung by some violent hand from a window of
the castle, made them an awful reply. The
greater number at once turned and fled; the few
who lingered were taken prisoners as a measure
of precaution; and Eberard, giving orders to
close the gates, sent ambassadors to Berne,
offering to become, himself and those of his
house, citizens of her city for ever, and to
cede to her, with a portion of his remaining
possessions, the fief of Thun. The Bernese
marched thither without loss of time, took possession
with little difficulty, and confirmed the
count in the place of power occupied by his
ancestors, on condition of his paying them a
contribution of one mark yearly.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>August.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >We have of late borne with some days of
Swiss rain, unintermitting from morning
to night. A <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pension</span></i> has one disadvantage:
for its inmates depend not on their own
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_50' id='Page_50'>50</a></span>
resources, but on the forced companions of its
breakfast, early dinner, and long evening. We
are fortunate in an agreeable party, particularly
so in the acquaintance of an English
clergyman and his charming young wife, who,
with her rosy children round her, forms the
prettiest picture imaginable. The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vie de pension</span></i>
consists in breakfasting, in irregular order,
between eight and twelve; dining at three,
which interferes sadly with excursions or occupations;
drinking tea at eight; talking till
ten; and going to bed to re-commence on the
morrow. This is bearable during sunshine;
but when we are shut up in bad weather, and
deprived of our home occupations, with torrents
falling all day, and the moon shining at night
in the valley on so dense and white a fog that
I at first took it for the lake, which is a mile
off, as has been the case the last few days, we
form in groups, and have recourse to a <em>leetle</em>
scandal (as I once saw it written), which commences
in the kitchen among the scourges
thither imported by the victims, their masters,
and steals by degrees among ourselves, where
it sometimes finds somebody</p>
<div class='c011'><span class='small'>“To point a moral or adorn a tale.”</span></div>
<p class='c013' >And should we all be good naturedly-minded
and charitable to our neighbours, we pounce
upon the cookery, and wonder that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_51' id='Page_51'>51</a></span>
Rufenacht</span> should be so niggardly an old personage,
and how long will last her dynasties
of hard ducks and bony pigeons. An addition
to our circle, and an improving one, arrived
to-day, in the persons of a gentleman and lady
from Marseilles, and whose conversation induced
us to let the poultry die and be served
up in peace. I was amused by his account of
their passage on board the steamer, from
Geneva to Lausanne. Of the party was a lady
speaking French imperfectly, and sketching
with remarkable assiduity, as she went along,
notwithstanding the velocity of the boat’s
motion. Monsieur R——, though not professionally
so, is really an artist; the lady was a
sketcher,—like one who described to me that
he never made more than two perpendicular
and three horizontal lines for any view, filling
up the vacuum after; or like another who,
having sketched the falls of the Rhine, showed
them to a lady, who exclaimed—“Oh! that is
the beautiful field we just now walked through,
and the stile we jumped over.”</p>

<p class='c010' >This lady had united to a very faint idea
of their geographical position a strong desire
of bearing away in her album drawings of all
the mountains in Switzerland; and the young
French gentleman could not resist the opportunity
for amusement: he had been her
interpreter already. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Blanc,</span> she heard all
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_52' id='Page_52'>52</a></span>
voices echo, and used her pencil in haste. The
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Buet</span>, with its white round head, was in sight
also, and the lady said in an interrogatory
tone, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Cenis, Monsieur?</span>”</p>

<p class='c010' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, Madame,</span>” said her deceiver gravely,
and she hurried to mark down the shape of the
mountain, and write under it “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Cenis</span>,”—extract
the leaf from her book, and with due
care lay it in her portfolio. She looked about
again.</p>

<p class='c010' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Pilatre, Monsieur?</span>” said she, forgetting
that Lucerne was not there; and pointing
to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voiron,</span>—</p>

<p class='c010' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bien loin, Madame; bien haut,</span>” said the
artist, and a cloud above the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voiron</span> was again
marked down, and inscribed <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Pilatre.</span>
The steamer was passing <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Coppet,</span> and Monsieur
R—— pointed out the château, giving it its
proper name.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Ha!” said the lady, cutting her pencil,
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Coppet château, Madame Staël.</span>”</p>

<p class='c010' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, Madame, voilà;</span>” but alas! for the
sketcher; below the château on the lake shore
is a square house, with a chimney at each end
of its ignoble roof, and three prosaic-looking
windows. It was this she believed to be
Corinne’s cradle. The drawing was completed
in a minute: two upright lines for walls; two
ears for chimneys; three blacker strokes for
windows; and under all, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Château Coppet.</span> You
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_53' id='Page_53'>53</a></span>
should have heard him describe the complacency
with which she drew a bit of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salève</span>
for <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Monterosa,</span> and the gratitude with which
she parted from him who had shown her</p>

<p class='c012' >An anecdote Monsieur R—— repeated last
evening, of a member of the national guard of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marseilles,</span> was too amusing to avoid telling
you in my turn:—</p>

<p class='c010' >Just after the revolution of 1830, troops
disembarked from Algiers, bringing with them
a large treasure, destined for Paris; it was to
leave Marseilles under an escort of the national
guard, as the lower orders were still in a state
of excitement, which might render its passage
hazardous.</p>

<p class='c010' >The person who commanded the escort had
our acquaintance under his orders, and Monsieur
R—— was rather surprised, on entering
the suburbs, to hear himself and his comrades
ordered to the rear, while the waggon with its
load of specie went, pioneer fashion, first. He
asked the reason:—</p>

<p class='c010' >“You see,” said the commandant, (a stout
peaceable man,) “that our charge being at
some distance from us, in case of its being
attacked we shall have notice of it before the
offenders reach ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_54' id='Page_54'>54</a></span>
“Therefore we had better ride to the front,
and be ready to meet them.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Not at all; we should be deprived of discretionary
power, being only six; by remaining
behind, we can best judge whether the attacking
force matches our own, or is too strong;
and may, at our choice, advance or retreat for
reinforcement.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The escort staid in the rear and the convoy
travelled in safety.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>Monday.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Notwithstanding the assurances of the whole
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pension</span>, that all cascades are alike,—that
wood, water, and mountain may grow familiar
to weariness; notwithstanding melancholy
prognostics of misfortunes, which may happen
to the horses,—and fine weather, which may
not last for our journey to Italy, I have insisted
on seeing the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Staubbach</span>; and to <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Interlaken</span>,
or rather towards <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Interlaken</span>, we rode
last Wednesday, for we were hardly a mile
away when the mist closed around us, obscuring
the view from the higher ground over
the lake and towards Thun, which is so lovely
in sunshine. D—— proposed turning back,
but we were averse to seeing the whole contents
of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Baumgarten</span> shake their heads at our
discomfiture, as they had done when foretelling
it ere we started. We took refuge instead
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_55' id='Page_55'>55</a></span>
under a pear tree in an old woman’s garden,
an agreeable situation, in which we remained
an hour, watching the torrents which concealed
everything else a dozen paces from us: and
as the bad weather did not set in as violently
as it sometimes does in the mountains, took
advantage of each clearer half hour to proceed,
and of the shelter the road afforded when the
rain returned.</p>

<p class='c010' >In this manner we arrived, not very promptly,
opposite <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Spietz,</span> whose old castle is romantically
placed on a promontory, near the road
and on the lake shore. It belonged to the
lords of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bubenberg,</span> and went by the name of
the Golden Manor. One of its most noted possessors
was Adrian of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bubenberg.</span> In the year
1470 he had been deputed to the court of Duke
Charles of Burgundy, and received by him
with esteem and affection. On his return he
remained attached to the Burgundian party,
inasmuch as he believed a continued peace
with Burgundy beneficial to Berne. <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hagenbach,</span>
however, had been seized and executed;
and Charles’s fury venting itself not merely in
menaces against Switzerland, he named his
officer’s brother to fill his vacant place, with
orders to cover the county of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ferrette</span> (the part
of Alsace which joins Switzerland) with flames
and blood. This fresh violence restored to
Nicholas <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Diesbach,</span> the zealous partizan of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_56' id='Page_56'>56</a></span>
France, the credit he had lost with his countrymen.
He sought to renew the treaty of
alliance with Louis the Eleventh; but aware
that Adrian of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bubenberg’s</span> influence would
be exercised on the opposing side, found means
to exclude him from the council, and taught
the people rather to take umbrage at his pride
of birth and dignity of bearing, than to remember
the part he had acted.</p>

<p class='c010' >Under various pretexts he was exiled to his
Golden Manor of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Spietz;</span> but when, in 1476,
Charles of Burgundy advanced, determined to
commence the campaign by the conquest of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Morat</span>, at the head of sixty thousand men,
the Bernese recollected their banished avoyer,
and, recalling him to their councils, implored
that he would take the command of the force
destined to garrison <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Morat</span>. The senator, who
had ever sought to avoid a perilous war, did
not hesitate to draw his sword in one become
inevitable. He demanded only implicit obedience,
and seeing that the greater portion of the
inhabitants were ill disposed, he proclaimed
that the first who showed fear or irresolution
would be punished with death! He also adopted
measures which had been already, on other occasions,
successful, separating friends and relations;
placing some within the town, and of others
forming part of the force destined to repulse
the besiegers. Wise, active, and courageous,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_57' id='Page_57'>57</a></span>
calm amidst danger, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bubenberg’s</span> conduct
and skill saved <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Morat</span>, to whose fate seemed
bound that of all Switzerland, and to him chiefly
did Louis the Eleventh of France attribute the
victory. Twelve Swiss deputies, Adrian of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bubenberg</span>
at their head, were despatched to the
French court, and received with royal magnificence.
The following year the conqueror of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Morat</span>
returned on a mission connected with the
succession to the throne of Burgundy. The
object of his embassy had altered gratitude
to coldness—esteem to hatred; faithful to his
own high character, firm and incorruptible, when
Adrian of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bubenberg</span> saw his colleagues won
and wavering, he disguised himself as a minstrel,
and returned alone to Berne; this was
in 1478. He died there the following year.</p>

<p class='c010' >The barony of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Spietz</span> afterwards belonged
to the family of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Erlach</span>, which counts among
its members Rodolph, conqueror of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Laupen</span>,
murdered by his son-in-law, and Charles Louis,
massacred by his misled soldiers when he
came to defend Berne.</p>

<p class='c010' >From <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Spietz</span> the road lately made skirts the
lake almost the whole way, and rather nervously,
as there are neither barriers towards
the water nor retreat towards the rock, which
has been blasted to leave a passage, and round
whose base it winds. As Fanny’s habit of
starting rendered the meeting of cart or
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_58' id='Page_58'>58</a></span>
carriage perilous, we cantered along while the
way was free, and to distract her attention
from the rivulets and small cascades dashing
down to her feet. Arrived at the extremity of
the lake, the rain fell in earnest; despite our
cloaks it threatened drowning: the mists were
sufficiently opaque for Ossian to rest his heroes
on; and the dim grey water which stretched
below, melting into and confounded with them,
looked mysterious and beautiful, as a single
gleam of pale sunshine struggling through the
vapour just touched the Neisen and descended to
rest on the surface. <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Unterseen</span> was ten minutes
nearer than <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Interlaken</span>, and, though we had
heard the hôtel called a bad one, the dripping
manes and drooping tails of our horses prayed
movingly for the nearest shelter. We took the
road along the bottom of the lake, and arrived
among the dark wooden houses, some of which
bear date of two hundred years ago. The
accommodation at the inn was better than I
had expected; but, considering we had come
thither for pleasure, our object was not
altogether accomplished, as we sat alone at
supper, faintly lighted by two candles at the
end of the large gloomy room, the storm beating
against the windows and the wind whistling
under the doors. Our bed-room looked on the
church, backed as it is by the steep sides of the
Harder, to which the clouds clung,—threatening
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_59' id='Page_59'>59</a></span>
an inauspicious close to our explorings;
and the most musical of German watchmen
woke us every hour during the night chanting
them and an appropriate rhyme in his fine deep
voice. Called as we desired, and the car
ready, the state of the weather, as we breakfasted
shivering in the same large room, looked
by no means promising, and the barometer had
continued sinking pertinaciously. Not choosing,
however, to ride back to Thun, as we had ridden
from it, in rain and fog, and our object unaccomplished,
we preferred driving in their
company to <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lauterbrunnen</span>; and leaving our
horses with strict charges to the stable servants,
we started rather silent and rather sad in
that chill morning at seven, over the four picturesque
bridges, which, crossing the Aar,
divide <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Unterseen</span> from <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Interlaken</span>. From one
of these there is visible between the nearer
mountains a view of the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jungfrau</span>, splendid
in fine weather. She looked mournfully
through the wreaths of heavy vapour like a
captive through her prison bars: by degrees
the mist rolled away, and we could admire
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Interlaken</span>, where you know D—— was prevented
passing part of his summer by the unfavourable
description given by ——. I should
prefer it even to Thun, for its green plain
nestles more closely under the hills. The
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pensions</span> are built on the same line, but apart;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_60' id='Page_60'>60</a></span>
with a mountain back and mountain view,
their gardens surrounding them, and a noble
avenue of old walnut-trees extending the whole
length they occupy. The road to <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lauterbrunnen</span>
winds through shady lanes and crosses
meadows of Swiss <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verdure,</span> and then lies beneath
wooded hills, on the summit of one of
which rises <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Unspunnen,</span> the castle of Byron’s
Manfred; a square and a round tower, from the
top of one of which spring two slight trees,
being all remaining. The marriage of the
baroness Ida of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Unspunnen</span> with <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Eschenbach</span>
of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wadischwyl</span> bare to the latter’s house her
father’s lands of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Unspunnen,</span> she being his only
child, and <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Oberhofen</span> her maternal inheritance.</p>

<p class='c010' >An illustrious ancestor of this <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Eschenbach</span>,
but more as poet than warrior, though for his
military exploits he was armed knight by Count
Poppo of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Henneberg,</span> was Wolfram; the year
of whose birth is not known with certainty, but
who lived when the emperors of the house of
Swabia had roused in Germany a love for
poetry, which had grown to passion: and the
verse of its votaries had a depth and brilliancy
which in no way foretold the coming barbarism
of the fourteenth century. His life passed in
the wanderings of a troubadour from court
to court, admired and honoured, as he retired
to the home of his forefathers but a brief time
ere he died. A zealous patron of letters and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_61' id='Page_61'>61</a></span>
his friend was the Landgrave <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hermann</span> of
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Thuringe,</span> at whose court of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wartbourg</span> (the
most romantic of mountain castles) congregated
the wisest and wittiest of their time. In the
year 1207 six noble minnesingers entered the
poetical lists there; <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hermann</span> and his fair wife
distributing the prizes, while Nicholas <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Klingsor</span>,
famed for his love ditties, as well as his
knowledge of necromancy and astrology, presided
as judge, summoned for that purpose
from Hungary. The general voice hailed Wolfram
conqueror; but <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Klingsor</span>, whom he had
unwittingly offended, in vengeance adjudged
the palm to his friend Henry of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ofterdingen.</span>
His superiority was, however, fully acknowledged
by the poets of Swabia, with all of whom
he was on terms of intimacy, and who styled him
sage and master. His genius was varied,—for
he was called the Homer and the Ariosto of
his day. Among the works his astonishing fertility
left to found his fame on, is a species of
drama, entitled the Combat of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wartbourg,</span>
containing the six pieces recited by himself
and his five troubadour companions in 1207 at
the court of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Thuringe.</span></p>

<p class='c010' >A hundred years later lived Walter of
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Eschenbach</span>, comrade and confidant of the parricide
Duke John of Swabia.</p>

<p class='c010' >When the latter’s father, Duke Rodolph,
died, leaving him a boy, the Emperor Albert
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_62' id='Page_62'>62</a></span>
sent for him to court, and held his patrimony
in his own hands as the orphan’s guardian.
The minor, become of age, demanded his
birthright, which Albert, under various pretexts,
refused; and the young man, exasperated
by each succeeding subterfuge, urged on
by the mockery of his partisans, who nicknamed
him Duke sans duchy, and the fear
that his uncle might intend his utter spoliation,
employed as mediator the bishop of
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Strasburg</span>.</p>

<p class='c010' >He begged that the emperor would at least
yield to his nephew some castles with their domains,
belonging to his paternal inheritance;
but Albert once more evaded a direct reply,
speaking of giving Duke John a command in
his meditated expedition against Bohemia,
and of satisfaction when the wars were done.</p>

<p class='c010' >The bishop returned from his embassy, the
young man heard its issue in silence, breaking
it only to observe, “the hand which grasps
my birthright menaces my life.” Quitting his
reverend adviser, he sought without further
delay the companions of his pleasures, who in
more serious moments were his counsellors also:
these were Ulric of Palm, Rodolph of Wart,
and Walter of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Eschenbach</span>.</p>

<p class='c010' >The 1st of May, 1308, there was held an
imperial banquet at Stein, at which Albert’s
sons and Duke John sate. By the emperor’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_63' id='Page_63'>63</a></span>
command wreaths of flowers were brought,
with which the children and disinherited prince
were alike crowned. There was some allusion,
some remark made, as to these diadems being
sufficiently weighty for the brows which sustained
them, to which John listened gloomily.
The banquet concluded, the emperor mounted
on horseback to proceed to <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Rhinsfeld,</span> whither
the empress had gone some days before. His
suite was composed of the unpopular favourites,
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Landenberg</span> and <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Waldsee,</span> his cousin
the count of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hohenberg,</span> and others of his
nobles and vassals. Pretexting a fear of overloading
the boat, arrived at the river Reuss,
John and his party found means to separate
Albert from his followers.</p>

<p class='c010' >He rode slowly and a little in advance
across the broad ploughed lands which stretch
beneath the hill and castle of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Habsburg,</span> the
territory of his ancestors, conversing with the
knight of Castelen.</p>

<p class='c010' >Suddenly riding up to his side, Duke John
exclaimed, “Receive the wages of fraud,” and
plunged his lance into his throat; at the same
moment Balm ran him through the body, and
Walter of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Eschenbach</span> clove his skull in twain
with a back stroke of his sword.</p>

<p class='c010' >Rodolph of Wart stood motionless, and Castelen
fled. Duke John and his friends, terrified
as by some unexpected crime, gazed at each
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_64' id='Page_64'>64</a></span>
other for the last time, and rushed in various
directions from the scene of their murder;
Albert had fallen bathed in his blood, and insensible.
His suite, congregated on the opposite
shore of the river, witnessed the assassination,
and fled in fear from their dying master.
A poor young woman passing by saw and
ran to raise him from the ground; he breathed
the last sigh in her arms: twice he essayed to
open his eyes, and at the third effort to do so,
died.</p>

<p class='c010' >Duke John took refuge in the solitudes of
the Alps, and wandered some days in the forests
which surround the abbey of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Einsilden.</span> Disguised
as a monk, he travelled thence to Italy,
where he threw himself at the pope’s feet, and
as a favour obtained from him permission to
hide beneath the cowl his remorse and friendlessness.
The remainder of his days passed
in obscurity as an unknown monk, it was believed
in the convent of the Augustines at
Pisa; and the blind man who sat begging in
the market-place of Vienna, was, it is thought,
as he asserted himself to be, son of John the
parricide.</p>

<p class='c010' >Rodolph of Wart, accomplice but not actor
in this tragedy, had sought protection with a
relative, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comte de Blamont,</span> who, for a
sum of money, betrayed him to Albert’s survivors.
He was married to a noble lady of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_65' id='Page_65'>65</a></span>
the house of Balm, who was fondly attached to
him. Having implored his pardon vainly on
her knees, before the Empress Elizabeth and
her daughter Queen Agnes, she determined
on affording him the consolation of her presence
when condemned to be broken on the wheel:
his sentence was executed. His torments,
ere they ended his existence, lasted three days
and three nights, during which his unhappy
wife remained kneeling near him in tears and
prayer, taking neither food nor drink.</p>

<p class='c010' >It was said by some that he had been wholly
innocent, and even unaware of the meditated
murder; he solemnly asserted it while his
broken limbs were stretched on the wheel.
When he had expired, his widow rose, travelled
on foot to Bale, and died. Ere yet Rodolph
was taken, Duke Leopold had entered his domains
in arms, put all his domestics to the
sword, and razed the castle of Wart to the
level of the ground. Jaques of Wart, his innocent
brother, reduced to beggary, lived the
remainder of his days in a poor cabin of
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Neflenbach,</span> a village founded by his ancestors.</p>

<p class='c010' ><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Farwangen,</span> the chief among the castles of
the lords of Balm, capitulated; but Duke
Leopold and his sister Agnes, queen of Hungary,
widow of King Andrew, caused sixty-three
nobles and many other warriors to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_66' id='Page_66'>66</a></span>
be conducted to the forest, and beheaded
there in her presence. It was then that
Agnes, as their blood streamed round her,
said, “I am bathing in the dews of a May
morning.”</p>

<p class='c010' >When the castle of the house of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Eschenbach</span>
(whose name has induced me to linger so long
on this story) was taken, and all the vassals of
Walter had been massacred, the soldiers of
Agnes, and herself also, were attracted by the
faint cries of an infant in its cradle, whom the
shouts and shrieks of the assailants and their
victims had fearfully roused. The boy was
so beautiful as to interest even Agnes, hard
and cruel as she was, till she discovered he
was Walter’s son, when she commanded that
he should be put to death also; and her officers
had much ado to shield this one life from the
fury which had exterminated before all those
who protected it. Yielding at last, she commanded
that he should renounce the name of
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Eschenbach</span>, and be called <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schwartzenberg.</span>
It is probable that the child did not grow
to manhood, for his father was last of his
line.</p>

<p class='c010' >Walter of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Eschenbach</span> sent to his wife the
deeds of the property she had brought him as
her marriage portion, became a shepherd, and
lived as one, in the county of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Würtemberg,</span>
thirty-five years. He made himself known
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_67' id='Page_67'>67</a></span>
only when at the point of death, and was interred
with the pomp due to the dignity of the
ancient family which in his person closed. On
the spot where the emperor was murdered, the
Empress Elizabeth and Queen Agnes founded
the monastery of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kœnigsfelden</span> the high altar
being built on the very place where he expired.</p>

<p class='c010' >No one crime was ever succeeded by so
many in pretended expiation. All who bore
the same name with any of the guilty; all who
had ever had connexion with them; all found
within the prescribed domains, were sacrificed
without pity. The accomplices not taken were
put to the ban of the empire, their marriage
vows dissolved, their friends commanded to
avoid their presence, their enemies permitted
to free themselves of their lives, their lands
adjudged to the empire.</p>

<p class='c010' >Agnes having founded the convent, ever
averse to communion with the world, hard,
cold, and cruel, though only six-and-twenty,
enclosed herself within its walls, distributing
alms, practising fast and penance, and performing
the most humble offices. It was in
vain however that she strove to attract to
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kœnigsfelden</span> the old brother Berthold of
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Offtringen,</span> who had been a knight and warrior,
and lived as a hermit on the mountain:
“Woman,” he said, “you serve God ill while
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_68' id='Page_68'>68</a></span>
shedding innocent blood, and founding monasteries
with the fruit of your rapine; only on
goodness and mercy doth he look with favouring
eye.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The road having passed <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Unspunnen,</span> skirts
a wild stream in an enchanting glen, the White
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lutschine,</span> which waters the valley of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lauterbrunnen</span>.
On entering the village of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zweylustchinenr</span>
the mountains open to leave a way
to <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Grindelwald</span>, and through the chasm rushes
the sister torrent, the Black <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lutschine,</span> a picturesque
bridge crossing the place where meet
these troubled waters.</p>

<p class='c010' >Our road lay straight before, made beautiful
by the varied forms and tints of the bold rocks
which are the belt of the White <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lutschine,</span> and
the dark and vivid green of pines and beech,
which rise among the crevices, or from the
strangely shattered summits of these crags,
stained brown and grey, like genius springing
from and brightening poverty.</p>

<p class='c010' >Somewhere hereabouts, where there is
barely room left for the car between rock and
river, one of the former, projecting over the
path sombre and sternly, once shadowed a
fratricide. Of the tradition I heard only that
the murderer was a powerful noble, who after
his crime left in remorse his castle to ruin,
and his lands to the first invader, and died in
his wanderings.</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_69' id='Page_69'>69</a></span>
The valley continued to narrow till we had
surmounted the ascent to the first houses of
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lauterbrunnen</span>. On the left was the rock of
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hunenflue,</span> having the form and regularity of
a bastion. Before us we saw the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jungfrau</span>,
who had dropped her veil, demanding I suppose
the sun’s homage on her maiden brow,
which he yielded soon after, but not until
we had seen the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Staubbach,</span>—alas! without its
iris.</p>

<p class='c010' >The fall is on the right hand, about a quarter
of a mile from the Capricorn, where we left
our conveyance. The new hotel, which bears
its name, and is built closer to it, commands
the best view, saving that from the mound
beneath it, which, in its deceitful neighbourhood,
appears a hillock, but whose steep side
I climbed with difficulty, and was puzzled
to descend with sober step. We offered
due reverence to the cascade, arriving ancle
deep in the rivulet, from the plank made
slippery by its spray; receiving a bath on the
before-named mound, where the voice of the
water was so loud we could not hear our own;
but certainly not aware that in its spring of
eight hundred feet it sometimes brings down
stones to break its admirers’ reveries. The
late rains had increased its volume and grandeur,
and therefore perhaps lessened its resemblance
to the tail of a white horse in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_70' id='Page_70'>70</a></span>
wind. In the winter it forms a colonnade
of ice.</p>

<p class='c010' >Along the wall of cliff which bounds this
side of the valley, are other falls of equal
beauty, though less fame. The <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jungfrau</span> and
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wetterhorn</span> close its extremity, and up the
mountains, on the stream’s opposite shore, the
green pastures stretch nearly to the summit,
dotted with chalets to receive cattle and herdsmen,
some seeming too high for human foot
to rest on. These and the poorer houses of
the village, which is scattered over the valley,
are built of whole pine trunks, rudely mortised
at the corners, a hole left for door and
window, and the heavy stones laid on their
roofs of bark, that the wind may not whirl
them away.</p>

<p class='c010' >The more aristocratic dwellings have the
sawn planks which form their walls carved
and ornamented, the open balconies of elaborate
workmanship, and below the jutting roof
inscriptions graven to recall the name of the
owner, and the year and day in which the work
was done, and generally some blessing, in
quaint rhyme, on building and builder.</p>

<p class='c010' >We had not intended a visit to the glaciers
of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Grindelwald</span>, but the day growing fine and
the road thither tempting us as we approached
the bridge, our resolution altered. The narrow
road winds along precipices, high above
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_71' id='Page_71'>71</a></span>
the Black <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lutschine,</span> and till it brought us
within sight of the glaciers, with the domes and
spires of snow which shoot up above them, I
thought less interesting than the way to <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lauterbrunnen</span>.
The two glaciers are well seen
from the inn windows and its garden. The
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mettenberg</span> separates them, the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wetterhorn</span>
forming the boundary of that nearest <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lauterbrunnen</span>.</p>

<p class='c010' >The places occupied by these seas of ice
were once, according to tradition, fertile
valleys, for in one of them was discovered a
buried chapel and a bell, bearing the date
1044. From the arch of an ice cavern in this
upper glacier issues the Black <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lutschine;</span>
green pastures, with wild flowers and strawberries
growing at their edge, are here on a
level with the masses of ice ever encroaching,
like death advancing to grasp childhood.</p>

<p class='c010' >In 1790, the innkeeper of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Grindelwald</span>, crossing
the glacier while driving a few sheep
home from the mountains, slipped down a
crevice, and found himself laid, with a broken
arm only, beneath a vault of ice, and beside the
torrent. Guided by the dim light which crept
through the fissures, he followed along its edge,
and issued through the arch into the world;
he was still living when Ebel wrote.</p>

<p class='c010' >The clergyman who in 1821 explored the
glacier between the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mettenberg</span> and <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Eigher,</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_72' id='Page_72'>72</a></span>
met with a similar accident, but which ended
fatally. He fell to a depth of seven hundred
feet, and his body, recovered after twelve days
of vain attempts, lies buried in the cemetery
of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Grindelwald</span>.</p>

<p class='c010' >We dined in company of a most hungry and
silent young German, and returned to <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Unterseen;</span>
the drive back lovelier than you can
conceive, for in the place of mist we had sun
and shadow; the torrent sparkling, and the
distant snow blending gold with rose colour.</p>

<p class='c010' >The horses were found in safety, Grizzle
demanding oats with the impatience and attitudes
of a wild beast. It is mournful to shut
oneself within a lonely room in a strange inn.
I walked, while the light remained, up the
flight of steps which, just opposite our hotel,
lead to the church, whose grey tower has the
Harder for background. In the churchyard
was something sadder than solitude,—the
tomb of an only son, who perished, aged
twenty-two, in the precipices of the Harder;
rose trees were cultivated on the turf, and a
bench placed opposite, where sits his mother,
who, for the last ten years, has every summer
made a six weeks’ pilgrimage from her far
home to his grave.</p>

<p class='c010' >We drank tea at one table of the enormous
room, while a noisy Parisian party from the
Rue St. Martin, or thereabouts, supped at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_73' id='Page_73'>73</a></span>
other, a young man of the family throwing
cakes in the air and catching them in his
mouth after the manner, he said himself, of
the bears of Berne; there are various modes
of seeking instruction when travelling: and a
lady, large and red-faced, informed her companions,
for our benefit, “how the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douaniers</span>
had complimented her on her black eyes, and
how they said they were a rarity in Switzerland!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Rising early, we left <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Unterseen</span> by the old
road, which passes through <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Interlaken</span> and
along the rocky bank of the river. In admiration
of the lake all the way, and having
enjoyed a lovely ride, and seen, without a
cloud to shroud them, the whole range of snow
peaks with romantic names which surround
the Blummis Alp and <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jungfrau</span>, we reached
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Baumgarten</span> early, and rejoiced in exchanging
the solitude of the dark old inn for the society
of Mr. ——, his pretty wife, and her gay
children.</p>

<p class='c013' >Left Thun the 9th, at eleven, as we waited
till the morning fogs, which have now grown
dense and cold, rolled up from the valley.
The last bad weather, which to us brought
rain, laid a light covering of snow on the
mountain summits, which the natives say is a
favourable sign. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Rufenacht</span> remains a
desolate widow. Madame R. and Mrs. H—— left
(wisely) some hours before us, as the mist
no sooner rises than the heat becomes intense.
The road was for some distance that we had
ridden towards <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Interlaken</span>; it turns off where
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_75' id='Page_75'>75</a></span>
the river <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kander</span> comes dashing along its
stony defile, and beneath its covered wooden
bridge, to the lake. Our route skirted its
precipices, and is very lovely where, at the
entrance of the valley of the Simmenthal, the
wooded base of the Niesen and the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Stockhorn’sr</span>
crags leave barely space for the road and the
torrent, which a one arched bridge spans. We
found at <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Erlenbachr</span> Mr. ——, who was to be
our companion on this day’s journey, and, to
our regret, this day’s only; as he is light-hearted
and light-footed, all annoyance, and
most fatigue, finding him invulnerable. Near
the village was an extensive horse and cattle
fair, through which, without the assistance of
his mountain pole and his hand on her rein,
it would have been difficult to guide Fanny
unharmed, particularly as, when they stood
“betwixt the wind and her nobility,” she took
a sly opportunity of biting two four-footed
plebeians. <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Weissenburg</span> is picturesquely
situated beside the torrent. We crossed it a
few steps further on a wooden bridge, where
horses pay a toll of a batz each, which the
receiver, in her fly cap, ran after us to levy.
The path to the baths winds up the hill on
the right hand.</p>

<p class='c010' >Further on, the river forms a pretty cascade,
boiling and bounding over its stones
below the precipitous road. Stopped at
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_76' id='Page_76'>76</a></span>
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zweizemmen</span>, twenty-seven miles from Thun,
a village of wooden houses with a wooden inn,
and nothing to eat. It was unfortunately too
late to go further, as the horses were the only
individuals passably lodged and in any degree
fed. With the exception of a damp, limp loaf
and a plate of nuts, our supper presented an
uneatable variety, and I was obliged to confess
that I had left comfort behind when I preferred
the romantic route of the Simmenthal to that
by Berne and Fribourg. A quantity of wearing
apparel, very far from new, hung round
my bed-room, which the servant, with German
phlegm, said “could not derange me as I lay
in bed,” and I had some trouble to get removed
in consequence. These wooden mansions
are like a sounding board, for, while I
was dressing this morning, I heard distinctly,
as if she had been in the room, a lady in the
next admonishing her daughter, and D—— and
Mr. —— conversing at breakfast below;
forming a tower of Babel colloquy. We had
such coffee as the French call <i>eau trouble</i>,
its few grounds floating to the top; and dismissed
the unborn chickens presented for eggs.
Our acquaintance parted from us here, hiring
a car as far as <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Château d’Œx,</span> whence he was
to take the footpath to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vevay</span> across the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dent
de Jaman</span>. We started after him, and on
the wrong road, no one belonging to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_77' id='Page_77'>77</a></span>
Wooden Crown attempting to set us right.
Over blocks of stone, and by a way which grew
steep and narrow as a mule-path, we toiled
debating whether we had mistaken, or this
was indeed what the natives called a passable
bridle-road. I asked a peasant at a cottage
window, “Is this the road to <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Saanen</span>?”
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ya,</span>” said the dame composedly, pointing
her hand with the stocking dangling from it
to the sharp ascent scattered over with lumps
of crag large enough to break a horse’s
leg.</p>

<p class='c010' >Looking down in despair, we could distinguish
another road far away on the other side
of the torrent and the valley. “Is that the
road to <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Saanen</span>?” I shrieked to a man who
was driving a goat.</p>

<p class='c010' >“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ya, ya.</span>”</p>

<p class='c010' >“And this we are going?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ya.</span>” So seeing no further information
likely, we led the horses down this stone
ladder in search of the new road, returning to
the village which it skirts without entering;
leaving me a hope that its completion will in
no way serve the abominable Wooden Crown
of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zweizemmen</span>. It is a grand work, a broad
splendid causeway for a long distance cut
along the face of the rock several hundred
yards above the torrent, but without the semblance
of a parapet, a circumstance of which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_78' id='Page_78'>78</a></span>
Fanny’s starts often reminded me. It crosses
the stream a dozen times over handsome
bridges built of stone. One of the principal
of these is yet in progress, and a young
German at work on the road pointed to the
steep sheep-track which dips suddenly down
to the torrent’s edge, and a narrow path which
followed its windings. Not much liking the
itinerary, we asked whether horses might not
pass over, but the German, who spoke a little
English, saying, “Peoples, only peoples,”
down obediently we went, passing under the
bridge, and pausing in the loveliest ravine in
the world, with its clear rushing water and
mountain sides covered with pines, those
near us brilliant in light and black in shadow;
and the faint mist shedding a blue tinge over
the further and higher forests; the bold arch
flung over at a considerable elevation, still
surrounded by its wooden framework, and all
the workmen, variously and picturesquely
attired, crowding to the edge to look down on
the apparition of Fanny pawing in the water.
Continuing to follow its banks, there being
neither guide nor finger-post, we crossed a
wooden bridge, without rails, broad enough
for one horse at a time, and high enough to
break our necks perfectly. The glen and the
path grew narrower, till at last we came on a
party of workmen, whose cart, laden with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_79' id='Page_79'>79</a></span>
stones, completely blocked our passage, and
the horses, which we tried to force into the
water, refused to stir, inasmuch as they did
not know its depth, and the crags it foamed
over were visible.</p>

<p class='c010' >The cart, from which the horses had been
taken, was immoveable, despite the united
efforts of the civil Germans—rather a fortunate
circumstance, as, on asking the question,
we found we were not likely to arrive
that way at <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Saanen</span>. One of the men left his
work to conduct us back to the bridge without
parapets, and up a narrow, slippery, and
perpendicular road, ranging over the admired
ravine, which happily brought us to a level
with the new bridge, and beyond it on the
way to <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Saanen</span>, to which unpicturesque place
we arrived by a short cut, for once successful.</p>

<p class='c010' >At the next village, we left the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Canton
Berne</span> for the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Canton Vaud.</span> Before entering
the latter at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rougemont,</span> from another
stone bridge, we saw a lovely assemblage of
torrent and mountain—one range all snow,
the rest with a robe of green pastures and a
crown of pine forests. Fed the horses at
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Château d’Œx,</span> a commanding feudal situation
when it belonged to the lords of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gruyères</span>,
perched on an eminence in the plain, backed
by wild crag and mountain.</p>

<p class='c010' >The road crosses the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Saane</span> and enters a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_80' id='Page_80'>80</a></span>
narrow pass called <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Latine. Montbovon,</span> the
village which Lord Byron mentions, is here in
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Canton</span> Fribourg, and from it ascends the
mule-path to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dent de Jaman</span>. Our own
road was far from safe, and at present almost
impassable for post-carriages, as for a considerable
distance between the rock and precipice
there would be no room to pass. We
fortunately met only two carts, and had some
trouble in leading our horses by, as there is
no protection on the side of the precipice; the
road rises and falls continually, cut through
the rock and the pines, and high over the
torrent. It continues thus for some miles, the
stream and valley then widen, and grow calmer
in their beauty. No one along these new
roads, undivided by league-stones, has an idea
of distance. We were told two leagues for
the last fifteen miles, and we were weary and
the sun low when we came in sight of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gruyères</span>, and admired its old castle and town
high on the hill, below which we wound. On
the authority of the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Baumgarten</span>, having
reckoned on twenty-five miles, we found we
had ridden forty-two. As the last faint light
was disappearing, we crossed the last stream
with its border of pines, and near the watch-tower
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Trême,</span> built on a rock, with an arch
by its side and dirty habitations round, and,
to my extreme satisfaction, arrived at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_81' id='Page_81'>81</a></span>
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cheval Blanc;</span> and little Fanny, recollecting
her bed of a month ago, walked straight to the
stable-door.</p>

<p class='c010' >We had our old room opposite the castle,
and the inn yclept <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hôtel de <em>la Mort</em>,</span> a most
ill-omened name.</p>

<p class='c010' >Three of the castle windows were feebly
lighted, and I heard, on inquiry, that the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">préfet</span> gave a ball; but not choosing to pay the
fine levied here, as well as at Geneva, on entertainments
during undue hours, the six young
ladies and fifteen gentlemen who formed the
company were invited to dance from five to
ten!</p>

<p class='c010' >It was fête at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bulle</span>, and everybody tipsy
in honour of it. I heard it was the anniversary
of the Virgin Mary’s quitting the convent
in which she had been educated, to marry St.
Joseph.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>Wednesday, September 11.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Arrived at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vevay</span>, the day having been as
burning as that on which we left it a month
ago. The horses gave a strange proof of
memory, insisting on stopping at a fir wood,
where we then rested them in the shade.
Persecuted by the small vineyard flies and
musquitoes, of which we were free in the
mountains, wearied by the horses kicking the
whole length of the steep paved hills, we were
glad to reach the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Trois Couronnes,</span> where we
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_82' id='Page_82'>82</a></span>
found our Thun acquaintances and the letters
we expected, but must wait for the baggage.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>16th September.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >We intended leaving <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vevay</span> last Friday in
company with Mr. and Mrs. H——, but Griselda
the patient having with great reluctance
allowed the putting on of three shoes, so positively
insisted on kicking the farrier and his
assistant from the off hind leg, that having
called her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rosse</span></i> and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">démon</span></i>, and sworn considerably,
they gave up the idea, leaving her
with three new shoes and a hoof with none.
This was an impediment to the journey quite
unlooked for, and rather disturbed our equanimity.
Saturday, D—— bribed the farriers
back, and after breakfast and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">goûter</span> they returned
to look at her and to talk, and at four
o’clock the business seemed still far from completion,
when one bethought him of tweaking
her nose. This operation, with the aid of two
pushing her side, one holding her leg, and the
fifth shoeing, proved successful. Little Fanny,
seeing her comrade surrounded to be sacrificed,
shrieked a melancholy neigh, as she was
tied in the corner.</p>

<p class='c010' >The gold was drunk merrily, and the exploit
of the five has been so exaggerated by
dint of telling it, that I should think the conquest
of the grey horse would remain, for all
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_83' id='Page_83'>83</a></span>
future travellers’ advantage, inscribed among
the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fastes</span>” of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vevay</span>.</p>

<p class='c010' >The rain has fallen in torrents during three
days; this morning was fine, and the road enchanting;
we passed again old <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Blonay,</span> and
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chastellar</span> on his hill, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Clarens</span> with her
foot in the water, and the peak of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jaman</span>
above the spire of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montreux</span>, the mountains
not like those of the Simmenthal, everywhere
dark with evergreen pine, but their sides
feathered with summer leaves, and the spiral
fir-forests, only far above, pointing against the
blue sky.</p>

<p class='c010' >Arrived at the narrowed road, and the high
grey crag opposite <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chillon</span>, Fanny walked to
the drawbridge, and but for the mist in the
valley of the Rhone rising gradually and
threatening, we should have paid it one visit
more. The view of the castle is far grander
from the shore than lake, as its uniformity is
broken by the three massive towers and the
keep which surmounts them, and it wears the
sober grey which should be the livery of a
feudal castle. We suspect the wall towards
the lake of having been lately whitewashed,
and the republicans have daubed thereon
an enormous device, inscribed <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Liberté</span> and
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Patrie.</span></p>

<p class='c010' >As we wound along the road towards <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Villeneuve</span>,
beneath the old walnut trees, we turned
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_84' id='Page_84'>84</a></span>
to see it and the prisoners’ isle, till D——,
who accuses me of always admiring scenery
backwards, cricked his neck. The tiny habitation
has no business on the island; the mountain
breeze should only blow over the three
tall trees and the flowers of gentle hue.</p>

<p class='c010' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Villeneuve</span> is an abominable hole: its inns
of the Croix Blanche and Lion d’Or looking
equally uninviting. Bidding here good-bye to
the lake, we enter the valley of the Rhone,
wild and muddy, with his eighty-four tributary
streams, already received in his passage through
the mountains. L’Aigle is a charming village,
hid in the hills. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bex</span> is not, in my opinion,
situated quite so prettily, but the inn has a
prepossessing appearance.</p>

<p class='c010' >A peasant pointed out the way to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salines,</span>
which lie in the mountain behind, but of them
you must ask descriptions elsewhere, for it
just then began to rain heavily, and we put
on our cloaks, bound for <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Martigny.</span> St. Maurice
stands, its castle on the crag, above the
road from Geneva, where a fine bridge crosses
the wild Rhone, its one arch flung from the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dent de Morcles</span> on the further side, to the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dent du Midi</span> on ours. Before us was a little
fort, thrown up by the Swiss in 1832, to defend
this already well closed pass. I thought it one
of the most striking spots I had seen in
Switzerland. You know the legend, that here
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_85' id='Page_85'>85</a></span>
in the year 302, the Theban legion was massacred
by command of the Emperor Maximilian,
and the place called St. Maurice, from
the name of the chief of these martyrs, who
refused to abjure Christianity. When we had
crossed the bridge, the grandeur and the
beauty merged in the muddy street of this
most filthy town; the contrast between the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vaud</span> we had left and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Valais</span> we had just
entered, marvellous, considering that the separation
is a bridge seventy feet long. Manure
heaps before the doors, and pigs revelling
in them once more; and the hideous goitre,
and more hideous cretin, telling at every step
their tale of unwholesome filth and misery.
One passed us with the usual vacant grin and
dead eye, and uttered a yell which startled the
horses; the wretched object wore a petticoat,
and we could not tell whether it were male
or female.</p>

<p class='c010' >Leaving the Rhone to our right, and now
again passing numerous crosses and chapels,
and votive offerings, which deprecate its fury,
we came at no great distance to a most desolate
spot, where the road for a considerable
way crosses a tract covered only with gravel
and crags, in melancholy disorder. Among the
rubbish is a roofless cottage, almost buried.
We were told that the bursting of a glacier in
1835 caused this desolation; a torrent of mud
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_86' id='Page_86'>86</a></span>
descended from the Dent du Midi, floating on
its surface the blocks of stone which ruined the
valley, sacrificing no lives, as its progress was
slow, but overwhelming fields, orchards, and
houses. It skirts the road for the length of
nine hundred feet, and is the saddest sight
imaginable; we were glad to exchange it even
for the low barberry bushes which, with their
pendent fruit, like coral branches, cover a soil
which seems to produce little beside.</p>

<p class='c010' >Shortly before reaching the waterfall of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sallenche,</span> we found that the Rhone had
broken his usual bounds, and overflowed the
narrow valley, more muddy in his rapid course
than ever. The rain had ceased falling, but
the mists lingered and deepened, and the
clouds lay ominously low on the dark bare
mountains. The fall is the finest I have
seen, from the volume of its foaming water,
and the violence with which it leaps from crag
to crag through the ravine it has hollowed
till it makes its last bound of one hundred and
twenty feet, and from the basin which receives
it, the spray mounts like steam. As, excepting
the elevated causeway on which we stood,
the whole expanse was here inundated, the
broad sheet of water under it, and blackness
of the crags surrounding, with a rare tuft of
green here and there, but mostly naked and
shattered, added to the grand melancholy of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_87' id='Page_87'>87</a></span>
the scene, the vale of the Rhone might form
a fit picture of the valley of the shadow of
death.</p>

<p class='c010' >Farther on a covered bridge, we crossed
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Trient,</span> a narrow but wild torrent, descending
from the Tête Noire, and issuing from the
black mouth of the stony gorge which opens
barely enough to vomit it forth.</p>

<p class='c010' >The rain recommenced, and we saw through
the mist the round tower of the castle of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La
Batie,</span> once a stronghold of the bishops of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sion,</span> built on the summit of a solitary rock,
not far from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Martigny;</span> between it and the
town we crossed the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dranse,</span> where it flows to
swell the Rhone.</p>

<p class='c010' >Arrived at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hotel de la Poste</span> we were
kept waiting a long time for the worst of all
meals, served up in a picturesque vaulted
hall, where fire and candles only made darkness
visible. We cut up the doubtful meat
only in mercy to the next comers. I imagine
this has been a convent, from the open pillared
galleries which run round the old house, and
the corridors and private stairs, and rooms like
cells.</p>

<p class='c010' >A black line drawn along the outer wall of
several houses in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Martigny</span> recalls the height
to which the waters rose in the inundation of
1818, when the masses fallen from the glaciers
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Getroz</span> into the valley first formed an
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_88' id='Page_88'>88</a></span>
obstacle, behind which the waters of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dranse,</span>
stopped in their flow, accumulated to a lake,
and at last yielding to the mighty pressure,
gave passage to the scourge, which in an hour
and a half had swept over the eight leagues
which divided it from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Martigny,</span> having borne
away all that stood in its path; the bridge of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mauvoisin,</span> ninety feet above its ordinary
course, three hundred habitations, and a
forest.</p>

<p class='c010' >It is wonderful that its column rushed, without
touching, past the village of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bauvernier,</span>
emitting a vapour like the smoke of a conflagration.
It went on to tear from their
foundations eighty houses at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Martigny;</span> its
surface covered with the bodies of drowned
cattle, and human beings, despite their warning,
taken unawares.</p>

<p class='c010' >One wondrous instance of preservation occurred
in the person of an old man, aged a
hundred years: there was a high mound,
formed of the wrecks cast there by the former
inundation of 1595. He would have been too
feeble to climb it for safety; he stood there
by chance when the roaring destroyer rushed
by, circling round, without wetting the sole of
his foot, as if it respected the monument of
its former power.</p>

<p class='c010' >This morning, 17th of September, started
early as we conveniently could, the innkeeper
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_89' id='Page_89'>89</a></span>
having told us, for our comfort, that the overflow
of the Rhone has cut the road between
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sion</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sierre</span>, and stopped the diligence.
The monks of St. Bernard have a convent
here, and when the climate has undermined
the health of their brothers on the mountain,
they are relieved from hence.</p>

<p class='c010' >The monastery of the Great St. Bernard is
distant but a ten hours’ journey; we intended
going thither, but feared to over-fatigue our
horses, yet I wished it much, from admiration
of these self-made martyrs, and also from the
romantic story of the founder. The castle of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Menthon,</span> for I must tell you this story, is
built on the height which overlooks the lake
of Annecy, in Savoy. An heir was born to its
noble possessors on the 15th of June, 923.
From early boyhood his taste and studies were
unsuited to close intercourse with the world;
and grown to a man, he resisted gently but
firmly, the will of his family, who had chosen
for his wife the heiress of the house of
Dwingt.</p>

<p class='c010' >As he was the only hope of their line, the
sole seedling of their falling tree, his parents
entreated and pressed him earnestly, and the
youth consented at last, unable to deny
them longer. The marriage morning came,
the fair young bride was adorned, and the
guests assembled, for there was to be feasting
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_90' id='Page_90'>90</a></span>
at the castle of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Menthon</span>. As the hour for the
ceremony drew nigh, it became matter of marvel
that the bridegroom should so long remain
absent. His chamber, where he had not slept,
and the domains of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Menthon</span>, were searched
vainly; Bernard had fled. The wedding
guests, one by one and whispering, departed,
and the maiden, ere yet she was a wife, was
left a widow.</p>

<p class='c010' >Years went by; the heiress was no longer
at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Menthon</span>, she had probably formed a more
auspicious alliance, and the desolate father
and mother had no son seated beside them
near the hearth of their hall. They had called
up hope till despair came in its place, and believing
him dead at last, they set forth on a
pilgrimage, not to the shrine of a saint, but
the feet of a living man, whose self abnegation
and holy life had become the discourse of
Christendom.</p>

<p class='c010' >Travelling by slow journeys, they arrived
through the snows at the summit of the mountain,
where the solitary lived in the hospital
he had founded, compassionating the dangers
which awaited travellers from France and
Germany to Italy. They found a man old
before age, worn with fatigues and hardships,
and knelt before him to ask his blessing, and
to beg he would say masses for the peace of
their son’s soul. The monk knew them, for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_91' id='Page_91'>91</a></span>
their old age had altered less than his youth:
and while he blessed them tremulously, they
knew his voice, and started from his feet to
fall on his neck and bless him also.</p>

<p class='c010' >He had fled from the wedding feast to the
city of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Aosta,</span> where he received holy orders
and became archdeacon of the cathedral. He
had preached at the peril of his life, in the
heathen Alpine valleys, and rooted out idolatry;
thrown down the statue of Jupiter still
worshipped on the mount Jou, the little St.
Bernard, and founded hospitals on each of
the mountains which now bear his name,
instituting for each one a congregation of
monks. He told his past life and his vocation
to the parents who had found him; they wept
together, and then they parted, as was his
will, they to return to their lone castle of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Menthon</span>, to pray for its exiled heir; he to
bury himself once more in the tomb he had
selected, and forget if he could that he had
seen forms and re-awakened affections which
drew him back to the world.</p>

<p class='c010' >St. Bernard preached in the Alpine valleys
forty-two years, and afterwards in Lombardy,
whence he travelled to Rome; he died at
Novara and was canonized.</p>

<p class='c010' >It is not surprising that the country about
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Martigny</span> should be unhealthy; the road from
this to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Riddes,</span> two posts and a half, is raised
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_92' id='Page_92'>92</a></span>
along the centre of a marsh, now overflowed
by the Rhone; the valley produces here only
rushes and rank-grass, which feed the thin
cattle scantily, and stunted birch trees, and
unprofitable barberry bushes, and a kind of
furze with a red berry. It seems a fitting
habitation only for the frogs, which croaked
and jumped by myriads from the wet bank to
the muddy stream as we rode along. The unfortunate
peasants scarce look like human
beings. I did not see two with throats undeformed
by enormous goitres. Cretins abound
in the valley, and those not belonging to the
idiot tribe have an expression of abjectness
and misery not much higher in the scale. They
are mostly of dwarfish stature, and the women
wear the small straw hat with turned-up brim,
ornamented with brilliant ribands of gold and
silver tissue, which show off in all their ugliness
their unwholesome complexions and ill-formed
features. At <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Riddes</span> the Indian corn is cultivated
again, and near <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Riddes</span> to the right is
a fine view of chasm and torrent, a castle above
and hamlet beside, breaking the sadness of the
drear valley and barren mountains. Farther
on are pretty villages, surrounded by fine old
walnut-trees and pastures, green as those of
the Simmenthal. In a field we rode by were
hay-makers busy; a woman called to desire I
would approach and show my strange figure.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_93' id='Page_93'>93</a></span>
I answered, at a like pitch of voice, that I had
not time, and we left merriment behind us.</p>

<p class='c010' >It would be difficult to fancy a finer grouping
of crag, river, and valley than approaching
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sion</span>. The Rhone to the right; the peaked
mountains rising before two crowned with
castles; to the left, highest and grandest,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tourbillon;</span> on the right, Valerie. The first
ruined, but nobly; turret and tower and
battlement standing as in the fine old age
which succeeds a strong manhood. Below, as
we approached the fortified wall, which,
flanked by its look-out towers, surrounds the
city, we saw the third castle of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Majorie,</span> once
the residence of the governors of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Valais</span>.
Behind the town, on another and almost inaccessible
crag, is the ruin of the castle of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Seyon,</span>
of which time, and siege, and fire have left
small remains.</p>

<p class='c010' >In the year 1375, Wischard of Tawell was
bishop of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sion</span>, and had governed the republic
of the Upper <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Valais</span>, under circumstances of
difficulty, during thirty-three years. This prelate
had so well merited the affection of the
people, and the confidence of the neighbouring
districts, that he was named the Count
of Savoy’s lieutenant-general in the Lower
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Valais</span>. He had attained extreme old age, when
one day while celebrating mass in his castle of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Seyon</span>, arrived with his suite his nephew Baron
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_94' id='Page_94'>94</a></span>
Anthony of Thurn Gestelenbourg,—whom his
high alliance and extensive domains rendered
one of the most important of the nobles. He
had some difference with his uncle respecting
the hereditary fief of the mayoralty of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sion</span>, purchased by the bishop, and to whose
rights and revenues he put forth claims which
the old man would not acknowledge. The
dispute grew warm and loud: whether the
baron of Thurn was, in his own person, guilty
of what followed, is a fact disputed. Those who
excuse him assert that his furious vassals, uninstigated
by his example, laid violent hands
upon the bishop: even while he held his
breviary, despite his feeble resistance and
prayers for mercy, he was thrust forth to the
abyss from a window of his rock-founded
castle. His subjects, who loved, rose to avenge
him at the news of his murder.</p>

<p class='c010' >Peter, baron of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Raron</span>, his brother and other
nobles, either did not partake in the general
opinion of Anthony’s guilt, or allowed party
spirit to deafen them to the claims of country and
the cry of nature. <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Brieg, Leuk,</span>
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sierre</span> and
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sion</span> vowed to avenge their
lost lord; and, first taking several
castles, met the assembled nobles near
the bridge of St. Leonard, and gained a
signal victory. The baron of Thurn vainly
sold to Savoy his domain of Gestelenbourg.
The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Valaisans</span> became its masters.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_95' id='Page_95'>95</a></span>
The baron of Brandis, a powerful noble of the
Simmenthal, through his mother, who was a
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Weissembourg,</span> marched his vassals to aid
Anthony. His ill-placed friendship cost him
his life, and his dispersed troops sped homeward
by the mountain passes. It was then
that the village of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">An der Leuk</span>, in the upper
Simmenthal, left without defence, as its men
had marched to battle, was entered by a
detachment of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Valaisans</span>, who threatened
pillage. The mountain women, bred to hardships
and danger, having their children and
their children’s property to guard, seized on
what arms had been left behind, and with the
energy of roused lionesses rushed forth and
drove back the enemy.</p>

<p class='c010' >Anthony of Thurn, forced to quit the country,
lived the remainder of his days at the
court of Savoy. About the year 1416, the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Valaisans</span> complained that no account had been
rendered of his male fiefs, (he died without
heirs in 1404), and expressed fears that these
also would fall into the hands of the all-grasping
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rarons</span>. These barons of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Raron</span>, as the
nobles of most ancient date and largest possessions,
were the sole persons whose power
counterbalanced that of the bishops of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sion</span>,
till the heir of the house was named to the
bishopric at the time his father held a post of
importance, and the opposition ceased to exist
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_96' id='Page_96'>96</a></span>
as soon as its cessation placed the whole
authority in the hands of son and father.</p>

<p class='c010' >The jealousy thus excited was increased by
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Raron’s</span> character and the personal dislike it
roused. By no means a hard or bad man, his
chief offence towards his country seems to have
been his contempt for their coarse habits and
lack of culture, and a predilection for the house
of Savoy. What these habits were may be
inferred from a list of laws passed by the
nobles, magistrates, and citizens in council,
when his power was at its zenith. They commanded
“that men should be stationed to
enforce the cleansing of the sewers, to prevent
their overflow; that no foul linen should
thenceforth be washed in water destined for
the town’s consumption, nor manure allowed
to accumulate before the habitations, and that
the high street should be swept at least once a
week.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The dislike to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Raron</span> increased from a report
which spread, that, after the invasion and conquest
of the valley of Ossola by the Swiss
troops, the baron had been heard to say, that
“had he been opposed to them there, not one
would have returned.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Offended by this speech, they dispatched to
Berne, of which city he was burgess, the landamman
of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Unterwald,</span> to demand full satisfaction
for words which, as they affected their
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_97' id='Page_97'>97</a></span>
honour, could not be passed by unnoticed. Berne
replied, that since she had vainly demanded
the baron of Baron’s aid in an expedition to
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Oltingen,</span> she had abandoned him to his own
guidance.</p>

<p class='c010' >The resentment of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Valais</span> gave henceforth
its own colouring to every action of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Raron</span> family, and in particular to its alliance
with Savoy. On a day when the inhabitants
of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Brieg</span> had assembled, to give loose to their
ever-increasing discontent, a few Savoyard
soldiers arrived in the village from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Simplon</span>
pass. They seized their arms, maltreated
and drove them forth, exclaiming that their
presence would be no longer borne with in
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Valais</span>.</p>

<p class='c010' >The authors of this outrage, for their own
protection, raised the country by means of an
expedient derived perhaps from some gone-by
custom. Assembling friends and comrades,
they bare at evening a large log to a place
where grew a young birch tree which they
rooted up. They carved the stump into the
rude semblance of a human figure, and placed
it in the centre of the branches, entangling
them with thorns and brambles, to represent
suffering justice encompassed by the trammels
of tyranny; and in proof of their determination
to free her, each drove a nail deep into
the stem of the birch tree. They bound the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_98' id='Page_98'>98</a></span>
figure, thus encircled, to a tree on the high
road (it was called <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Mazza</span>), and lingered
near the spot to mark what might follow.
Those who came that way at dawn stopped
also, and there soon gathered a multitude, as
yet in expectant silence and passive. At last
one advanced and unbound the “Mazza,”
and placed himself at its side in the centre of
the crowd. Several voices next apostrophized
her, demanding what injuries brought
her thither, and treating her silence as the
effect of fear caused by an unjust power.</p>

<p class='c010' >“If,” they said, “there be in this assembly
one man who loves his country sufficiently to
be the Mazza’s questioner, let him advance!”</p>

<p class='c010' >An instigator of the scene stepped forth:—</p>

<p class='c010' >“Mazza,” he said, “they are sworn to aid
thee: whom dost thou dread? Is he of the
race of Silinen; of the houses of Henn or
Asperling?”</p>

<p class='c010' >The figure, and the man who had stood
beside her from the first, remained motionless;
and the speaker continued to enumerate the
noble names of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Valais</span> with as little success
as before.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Is it,” he said at last, “the baron of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Raron</span>?”</p>

<p class='c010' >The wooden figure was bent low to the
ground in signal of assent.</p>

<p class='c010' >“You mark her complaint,” rejoined the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_99' id='Page_99'>99</a></span>
orator; “you who will succour her raise the
right hand.”</p>

<p class='c010' >A large majority obeyed; a near day was
appointed; and the news was sent from village
to village, “that the Mazza was about to visit
the captain-general, the bishop, and all the
partizans of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Raron</span>.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The plot succeeded throughout; neither
the lustre of their ancient name, nor the favour
of a foreign prince, nor the first dignities of
the land united on their heads, prevented the
various districts of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Valais</span> from planting on
the appointed day, and by unanimous consent,
the ill-omened Mazza before all the unfortified
castles of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Raron</span> and his partizans. The
multitude forced a way, and pillaged from
vault to battlement. Had <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Raron</span> remained
in the country, he too, doubtless, would have
fallen sacrifice to the Mazza. He had gone to
Berne, there to renew his treaty of co-citizenship,
and obtained, on the conditions of resigning
his place of captain-general, and leaving
Bishop William to his own resources, a promise
from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Valaisans</span> to persecute him no
farther.</p>

<p class='c010' >He believed that (his foes appeased) time
might restore to him the power he had exercised
in days past; but there was nothing
which those enemies so dreaded, and they
worked on the passions of the already-excited
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_100' id='Page_100'>100</a></span>
people, till rising again they marched on and
destroyed his castle at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sierre</span>,—took a fortress,
held by the bishop, at <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Leuk</span>,—and besieged
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Beauregard</span>, which, built on a rock, had long
seen beneath its sway and protection the valley
of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ennfisch,</span> whose fertile meadows stretch to
the very foot of the Alps of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Aosta.</span></p>

<p class='c010' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Raron</span> returned to Berne; but Berne was
occupied wholly with the affairs of Frederic of
Austria, and feeling that to the bishop and
himself hesitation might be fatal, he demanded
for both the aid of Savoy. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span> the Eighth,
created duke by <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sigismund</span>, charmed to find a
pretext for interference, commanded <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span>
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Challant,</span> then in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chablais,</span> to leave it with
sufficient force, and take under his own protection
and out of the bishop’s hands, the castles
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Majorie</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tourbillon</span>. On his side the
baron of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Raron</span> victualled his strong hold of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Seyon</span>, conducted within its walls his wife and
children, the Bishop William, and all the aged
and infant members of his house, charging
with its defence his most tried and brave
vassals. A numerous and staunch garrison
held <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Beauregard</span>, and the heat of that burning
summer aided its efforts by paralyzing those
of the besiegers, till at last conquered by
famine and forced to open their gates, the
soldiers as they marched forth saw lighted
behind them the flames, which, consuming the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_101' id='Page_101'>101</a></span>
castle, illuminated the entire valley. The insurrection
became so serious, that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span> of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Challant,</span> fearing for <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chablais,</span> concluded a
truce, which peace soon followed; but although
the baron of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Raron</span> had placed sole confidence
in the duke of Savoy, the latter, when renewing
his ancient treaties, made no stipulations in
his favour, delivered to the bishop neither
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tourbillon</span> nor <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Majorie</span>, ceding both for a
sum of money to the chapter. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Valaisans</span>
pillaged and destroyed them: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Seyon</span> remained
alone; the riches of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rarons</span> were plundered;
their power had departed. His courage
only remaining to support him, the baron
again entered Berne, and appeared in its
assembly with none of the splendour, but
more than the dignity of past years: he was
received as its citizen once more. Meanwhile the
forces of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Valais</span> besieged <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sion</span>, determined
on the total ruin of Wischard of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Raron</span>. The
negociations between Berne and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Valais</span>
grew stormy: the latter insisting on the surrender
of the castle, but consenting to let all
within it go free. The lady of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Raron</span>, profiting
by the permission, came trembling forth,—slowly
treading the steep way, followed by the
Bishop William, her younger children, and a
long train of menials. It was then that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Seyon</span>
fell. The multitude thronged thither, bearing
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_102' id='Page_102'>102</a></span>
torches, and its noble halls were sacked and
fired.</p>

<p class='c010' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sion</span> had abjured all respect towards this
illustrious family, and the unhappy lady, who,
born in luxury, had long been the spouse of
these countries’ most powerful lord, descending
the heights of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Valais</span>, and traversing
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pays de Vaud</span> in the haste of fear with her
melancholy train, repaired to Berne. Her
husband, listening to his angry passions only,
while the debate concerning his cause was
still pending, sought the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Oberland,</span> and
gathering round his banner all the brave
youth of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Frutigen,</span> the Simmenthal, and
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Saanen</span>, marched at nightfall from the latter
village, and along a narrow valley, which
bears the name of Gsteig. The dawn was
hardly red on the mountains when they
climbed the steep paths of the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sanetsch,</span> near
the great cataracts; and appearing before
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sion</span> at the dinner hour of its inhabitants,
mastered their resistance easily. In the course
of some hours <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sion</span> was reduced to a few
streets, the remaining space it had occupied
a mass of smoke and flame, and the troop,
when it had ravaged the surrounding lands
three days, returned by the way it came,
having hardly lost a man.</p>

<p class='c010' >The negociations between Berne and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_103' id='Page_103'>103</a></span>
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Valais</span> were succeeded by war; to put a stop to
which, the neutral cantons interfered, and at
last, through the mediation of the duke of
Savoy, it was decided that Wischard of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Raron</span>
should be reinstated in his lordships, and receive
as indemnity for his losses the sum of 10,000
florins. Yet, notwithstanding this, Wischard of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Raron</span> died far from his own land; his opulence,
his noble name, his chivalrous virtues
availed nothing to one who had neglected to
conciliate the affection of his countrymen, and
their caprice cast down an authority which rose
no more.</p>

<p class='c010' >Entering the town, a dirty street leads to an
inn of unprepossessing appearance. We passed
on to the left, winding half round the base of the
crag on which stands <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tourbillon</span>. We passed
a picturesque monk in his robe of brown serge,
with a fine face and shaven crown; and a squinting
specimen of the same species, who, I think,
chose the cowl that it might serve for veil at
need, he drew it so closely over his face when
I asked him a question.</p>

<p class='c010' >As we slowly descended the road which
skirts the Rhone, we could long look back on
this romantic castle, dark on its shadowed
crag, while the sun made a sheet of silver of
the swollen river, which spread beyond its
natural shores, forming islets and peninsulas
innumerable, circling round the peaked
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_104' id='Page_104'>104</a></span>
mounds, which, varying in height from fifty
to two hundred feet, their crags gay with vegetation,
crowd the valley,—first created, Ebel
says, by the violent Rhone cutting a deep passage
among the rubbish and ruins cast in his
bed by the earth—avalanches of the mountains;
and increased by that driven along at
each succeeding flood. They look as if a portion
of chaos had been left when the rest was
softened into a world.</p>

<p class='c010' >Riding without shade under the craggy hill
and over the river, we followed vineyards for
some distance, and as the branches hang within
reach, and we were hot and thirsty, I did not
keep my hands from picking and stealing, and
we went on, refreshed by roguery, till we had
nearly met with merited retribution: for at a
place whence the Rhone had just retired, his
slime left on the road made such perilous footing
for some hundred yards, that our horses
had several times almost brought us down with
themselves, which there would have been unpleasant,
as we should infallibly have rolled
into the river. At the entrance of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sierre</span> we
passed the ruin of its demolished castle, one of
those belonging to the ill-fated <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Raron</span>. Found
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Soleil</span> infinitely better than the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Poste</span> at
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Martigny,</span> and cleaner than report describes
the inn at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sion</span>. The number of cretins at
this place is fearful, and you must see them to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_105' id='Page_105'>105</a></span>
feel their degradation, and ours, that beings,
so below brutes, should indeed belong to our
species—large heads and old faces on the frail
bodies of children, and with the weak limbs of
a cripple,—goitres, of an enormous size, swelling
the throat and hanging over the strangely-formed
chests, and sometimes all the faculties
wanting—the ear deaf; the tongue dumb;
the eye having no “speculation” in its glare;
and the enjoyment to lie rolling in filth, or
basking in the sun, like some unclean animal.
As I stood at the inn window, three of these
wretched creatures appeared in the place
below; they were attracted by a part of my
dress, and staid grinning at me, demanding it,
after their manner, with signs and inarticulate
sounds. I could have ascribed to their
colourless and withered countenances neither
sex nor age. The peasants treat and speak to
them kindly; but I doubt their considering
now, as in darker times, the presence of one of
them in their families a blessing; and such as
are free from the curse ascribe it to the extreme
dirt, if not of the present, of past generations.
The water of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sierre</span> is unwholesome,
and drunk cold produces instant hoarseness.</p>

<p class='c010' >The diet of the Upper <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Valais</span> is sitting here;
the diet of the Lower <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Valais</span> at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sion</span>: it is
curious that the two districts divide the possession
of the latter town.</p>

<div class='c008'><span class='small'>18th September.</span></div>
<p class='c009' >Left <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sierre</span> early, and found, when but a short
distance on our way, that the damage done by
the Rhone had not been exaggerated. We
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_107' id='Page_107'>107</a></span>
crossed it on a bridge, and beyond, in lieu of
the road which had been there, found a broad
and deep deposit of the river, which had
broken and swept it away. Three hundred
workmen are employed since the overflow, and,
as none of our party could swim, we stopped
to inquire at which part it might be fordable.
One of the men came good-naturedly forward
to lead Fanny, and in and to her shoulder in
water we went, Grizzle following, and arrived
safe at the opposite shore. Rode fast up the
hill to dry ourselves, leaving our friend grinning
at his fee, and shaking himself like a gay
poodle. The route here turns through a pine
forest, a wild and beautiful way, St. Bernard
and the range of brother Alps behind. The
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gemmi</span>, to the left, topped with snow, and the
Rhone at its foot, and, on our right, cliff above
cliff,—not cold, white, or grey, but rich with
tints warm and beautiful; and fir woods below
them and around us, covering the peculiar and
conical mounds. A tract of forest on one of
these had been burned, probably by lightning
or inadvertence, and the scathed and blackened
trunks stood like the plague-stricken
among their green fellows. The road skirted
the river, still on our left, and we saw opposite,
on the mountain, a romantic village with
an old turreted castle, to which conduct a
wooden bridge, sinking ominously in its centre,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_108' id='Page_108'>108</a></span>
and a steep winding road. It commands the
noble gorge in the grey rock, through which
rushes the Dala river, and the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gemmi</span> surmounts
it in turn. This is the village of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Louëche</span>, and its famous baths are about nine
miles higher in the mountain. I might give
you an account of these hot springs, which
flow at five thousand feet above the level of
the sea, but that I think I might weary you.
They must be of extraordinary efficacy, as the
cold of morning and evening at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Louëche</span> does
not impede the cure, though snow sometimes
falls there in July; and crowds frequent them
notwithstanding their inconvenient position
and the total want of comfort, often of necessaries,
in the dilapidated wooden dwellings
which receive the sick. It is strange that the
water which at its source will harden an egg
and scald a fowl, and in which one cannot, from
its extreme heat, plunge the hand, so soon
loses this quality, that it may be received in a
glass and immediately swallowed without
annoyance.</p>

<p class='c010' >Near <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tourtemagnen</span>, where there is a strange
looking inn, but I hear comfortable notwithstanding,
the beauty of the country wholly
disappeared, for the road ran among pools and
marshes—the melancholy cows standing to
their knees in water to eat the high coarse
grass which half grows, half floats, around—the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_109' id='Page_109'>109</a></span>
few trees which have attained any size
bent and blasted by the searching wind; the
wretched stunted women, who would be prodigies
of ugliness even without the goitre,
were digging in the mud for the unwholesome
potatoes which grew there.</p>

<p class='c010' >The day had grown cold and foggy, and
lighted sadly the late ravages of the Rhone—painfully
visible; as its widened bed now dry
once more swept over meadows and fields of
Indian corn, and left, on its retreat, desolating
heaps of stones and sand. We passed here
and there a shattered mill and a ruined
habitation—the owners mostly standing idly
and hopelessly on the bank—a few striving to
combat with misfortune, and reap the rotting
harvest; or at least collect the logs flung to
their feet on the shore—relics of bridges
broken and scattered in the contempt of the
waters they had spanned for a time. We
compared it to a land visited by a curse;—the
struggle seemed so unequal between earth’s
frailest race and her heaviest disasters.</p>

<p class='c010' >I think it is after passing a village of some
miserable huts called St. Pierre, that it improves
for a space—green pastures once more
ascending to the pine forests, and neater wooden
houses covered, for the first time, with trained
vines. The peasants seemed miserable as ever,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_110' id='Page_110'>110</a></span>
ragged, and famished, but a spice of coquetry
remaining through it all, for the outwork of
broad riband with a tinsel border eternally
trimmed the low crown of the felt hat.</p>

<p class='c010' >With the exception of this and one other
portion of better land, the marshes stretch to
Visp, and the thick air is impregnated with
miasmas. Visp is built where the valley parts
itself in two distinct branches. The one, down
which rushes the torrent which gives its name
to the village, leading to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Monterosa</span>; but it is
the Haneck and not <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Monterosa</span> whose white
mass, seen from this spot, terminates the defile
of the Moro. The Visp is here broad and
rapid as the Rhone, yet this place, situated
near their junction, is filthy as all villages in
the catholic cantons,—their united streams
cannot wash the blackamoor white.</p>

<p class='c010' >After traversing the streets, our road wound
grandly and perilously round the base of rocks
blasted for its formation; but this portion passed,
we were again amidst the marshes, and between
Visp and Glys the overflow of the Rhone has
done most damage, as it is hereabouts swollen
by numberless tributary streams—most turbulent
vassals. Our horses sank above the
fetlock in soft mud, which covered the whole
face of the valley: Indian corn and pumpkins
floating on its surface. The ground floors
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_111' id='Page_111'>111</a></span>
of the deserted cabins were flooded, for through
this desolate tract wound a stream whose
deposits made pools deep and broad; and
planted in the mud, or half drowned in the
water, were several small wooden crucifixes
and Madonnas, placed there to deprecate its
further rise.</p>

<p class='c010' >We passed through Glys, in whose church
lie buried Georges of Flue and his twenty-three
children. At the entrance-gate stands
the Virgin Mary, the iron glory round her
head resembling the snakes of Medusa; and
over the portico is a painting of the heavenly
Father, extending his mantle over multitudes
of the faithful, who look like deformed children,—the
native artist drew, alas! his inspiration
from the goitre-afflicted and the cretin.
The last bridge which we crossed over the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saltine</span> leads directly
to <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Brieg</span>, and at the
window of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hôtel de la Poste</span> we saw the
pretty face of Mrs. —— looking out to greet
our coming. The pine log fire blazing in the
wide hearth was agreeable this chill evening,
and her voice and laugh aided to dispel the
impressions left by the dull air of that desolate
valley. There are rumours of the impossibility
of crossing the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Simplon</span>, of roads injured
and bridges broken by some recent storm—the
postmaster’s son has been sent hence to
verify their truth, and we wait his fiat.</p>
<div class='c008'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_112' id='Page_112'>112</a></span>
<span class='small'>September 19th.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >It is decided that we are to go, the courier
from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sierre</span> having passed
through <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Brieg</span> at
daybreak with news that the road is open.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>September 21st., <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Domo d’Ossola.</span></span></div>
<p class='c010' >After two days’ silence, I write again to
give you a recital of adventures which have
befallen us wayfarers. Our friends and ourselves,
with the rest of the party assembled at
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Brieg</span>, left after breakfast, and we hardly said
good-bye to Mr. and Mrs. H——, in whose
company we were to dine at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Domo d’Ossola.</span>
The morning was cloudy and cool, changing
to the loveliest of days. Half a mile above
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Brieg</span> we passed the covered bridge which
crosses the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saltine</span>, and is the first of the works
of the mountain, for it is on the direct road,
which begins from Glys, but is seldom taken,
as there is no inn there. At this spot they
join, and the ascent grows steeper, turning
away from the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Glytzhorn,</span> which bounds the
valley on the right, towards its comrade the
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Breithorn.</span> Our horses, at a walk, soon left
behind the posters and heavy carriages, and
we passed beneath a hill, at whose summit is
a Calvary, the stations conducting thither
peeping whitely out among the thick dark
firs. The valley of the Rhone looked beautiful
below, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Brieg</span> in the plain, the tin globes
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_113' id='Page_113'>113</a></span>
which surmount her minaret-like steeples
shining in the sun as if his rays had kindled
so many stars; behind the town and the high
bridge which spans the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saltine</span>, dashing
towards the Rhone, arose the mountains—parted
by the deep and narrow cleft whence
the river issues; and again above these were
the glaciers, their forms half concealed by the
vapours which, as we ascended, partially veiled
the range of Bernese Alps also, but made our
road the lovelier;—where, skirting the precipice
from the depths of the gorge through
which the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saltine</span> foams, they rose curling thin
and delicate as the smoke from a cottage
chimney, or, lying at our feet for a few
moments, impenetrable as a floor, slowly
opened to show the torrent, glittering among
its black crags, and the green forests, all dew
and sunshine. At several of the windings of
the road, now steep but always smooth and
broad, and almost always protected, we again
hung over what seemed a miniature of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Brieg</span>
and the valley as far as <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tourtemagnen</span>, till
arrived at a certain height, it runs nearly on
a level along the edge of the ravine of the
Ganther to the bold bridge at its extremity.
Beneath its arch, from the rocks which back
it, rushes the torrent, forming a cascade in its
leap, where in winter roll the avalanches.
Crossing this bridge, we returned on a parallel
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_114' id='Page_114'>114</a></span>
line with that we had already gone on the
opposite side of the valley: we could distinguish
the carriages some miles behind. The
route ascends thence in steep zigzags to
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Berisol,</span> a post-house and poor inn.</p>

<p class='c010' >Fanny sometimes started at a pine trunk
fallen on her path, or a cow feeding above
us with its tinkling bell, or obstinately refused
to pass some unfamiliar object, such as the
poor priest who, book in hand, was summoning
a dozen white goats from the pinnacles on
which they were perched feeding, and who
came bounding from crag to crag at his call.
At such times, to distract her attention, we
cantered along through the sunshine and
sweet air, acknowledging its influence, for
on the broad road there was little danger; it
is certain the mind has less energy, and the body
feels more fatigue, on the plain. Somewhere
hereabouts we crossed a bridge of planks without
parapets, not dangerous however. Here
also a stream gushes from the rock, and passes
under to foam and lose itself among the pine
trees,—some standing to fringe its shores,
others, broken by its force, lying at its feet to do
it homage. It is one of the sweetest glimpses
on the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Valais</span> side of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Berisol.</span> The last named
place consists of two houses, connected by a
roof which crosses the road; and here we
passed more carriages, ourselves proud and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_115' id='Page_115'>115</a></span>
rejoicing in the lesser weight which enabled
us to desert them all. Continuing to mount
higher, our way became more wild till we had
passed the pine region, and the crags were
clothed with rhododendron only, whose blossoms
lent beautiful tints to the far mountain
side. Here and there we saw a solitary tree
broken by some avalanche, or raising boughs
withered and whitened by the ungenial climate.
But the sterility is almost total near the
Gallery of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Schalbet</span>, the first which we traversed:
it is hollowed through a rock which
obstructed the passage of the road, here cut
along the verge of the precipice and edge of
the bare mountain, narrower and without
barriers.</p>

<p class='c010' >From the fifth refuge, which immediately
follows this cavern of ninety-five feet long, to
the summit, is the place of peril in the time of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tourmentes</span> and avalanches. I looked with
some attention to the snow, which, lately
fallen, had accumulated thick and far above
our heads, and to the track of the avalanches,
now marked by stream and torrent, which
rush down the chasms uttering their ominous
roar, repeated and prolonged by all the mocking
echoes of the mountain. We were beneath
the glaciers of the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kalt Wasser,</span> and, to afford
adequate protection to the road they threaten,
two houses of refuge, three galleries, and an
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_116' id='Page_116'>116</a></span>
hospital, have been erected within a brief
distance. The second of these galleries passes
beneath one of the mighty falls, and our horses
started to find themselves wet with its spray,
as, carried over the roof, it dashes down before
one of the apertures which light it.</p>

<p class='c010' >The longest of these glacier galleries has
been blasted through the living rock, within
which it turns, and damp and cold it is as a
dungeon—the water distilling through the fissures
in its roof, forming in winter long needles
of crystal, but now dropping mercilessly on
our heads, changing the soil to a sea of mud;
and the draught of air striking a chill so
penetrating, that to save the horses from harm,
we trotted them the one hundred and thirty
feet which form the length of this gloomy
cavern.</p>

<p class='c010' >A little further, we passed the sixth refuge,
which is the toll-gate also. The receiver,
who came running out, found time to tell that
he had served in the Hanoverian guard, and
fought at Waterloo, and also to cheat us of
two francs per horse, the toll amounting to
four for the two. It was twelve o’clock, he
said, so that we had ascended in three hours,
for here is the cross which marks the highest
point of the road. It continues bare and
wild; but down in the meadow, which seems
rather to produce a kind of moss than grass,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_117' id='Page_117'>117</a></span>
there are scattered a few wretched cottages;
heaven knows what the inhabitants exist on.
The hospice founded by Napoleon, and at
present occupied by a few Augustine monks,
is a fine-looking building without, but desolate
and unfinished within. We were saluted as
we rode by two of the lonely brothers, who
were wandering on the irregular hillocks which
surround it, bare of bush or verdure, surmounted
by the unchanging snows. In the
broad valley below our road, shut in by rocks
naked as itself, rises on a mound the square
six-storied building, or rather tower, which
served for hospice ere this was instituted. A
few cows were standing before it, chewing the
cud—“of sweet and bitter fancies” it must
have been,—for there appeared nothing to
swallow bodily. It is said that the old barons
of Stockalper were in the habit of sending
hither their children to preserve them from
the baleful influence of the air of the plain:
it still belongs to a proprietor of the same
name.</p>

<p class='c010' >From this place the road commences and
continues to descend. We were among green
and living things once more, and the milder
temperature restored to activity that worst
of all species of crawling fly which had
already so persecuted our horses in the ascent,
and, notwithstanding my long apprenticeship
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_118' id='Page_118'>118</a></span>
in fly murder, consequent on our ride, resisted
all efforts to kill, being cased in armour, till I
adopted suffocation, and therefore, for the
benefit of future horse travellers, recommend
that they be pressed between finger and thumb
until death shall ensue.</p>

<p class='c010' >Crossing a torrent on a bridge, at last, about
two leagues from the summit, we entered the
most dirty village of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Simplon</span>, where we had
decided to stop only to feed the horses, who
were well able to end their day’s journey at
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Domo d’Ossola</span>: it is built on a knoll above
the rapid stream, commanding an unproductive
valley. The houses, built in stone, take
mellow and picturesque tints from the moss
and lichens which clothe them, and winter lasting
here during two-thirds of the year, the
small garden, which each possesses, is cultivated
almost in vain. The clearing of the
snows and the transport of merchandise (for
it has been calculated that at least two hundred
horses pass weekly in the severe season)
supply to its hardy inhabitants, the profit
more easily won in other regions, preserving
from the misery which would seem their doom.
Traversing courageously heaps of manure and
pools of abomination, D—— accompanied the
horses to the stables, while I walked into the
inn opposite, before which stood a collection of
English and other carriages, and on the steps,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_119' id='Page_119'>119</a></span>
in discussion or dispute, discomfited gentlemen
and villanous-looking Italians. The house
was crowded to overflow, a circumstance which
appeared to improve neither its attendance
nor the politeness of its landlady: for when I
asked the last-mentioned fat personage for
some refreshment, she handed me to her sharp-faced,
thin daughter, who left me on the stairs,
saying the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle</span> was at the top, and disappeared,
promising to ask the cook if he had
anything to eat, which she said she believed
he had not, owing to the immense influx of
guests who had come thus far, unapprized of
the road’s real state, and stayed from the
impossibility of proceeding. As she did not
come back, I found my way through corridors
innumerable to the kitchen, and stood opposite
the cook and his company of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marmitons</span>. Perhaps
he felt mortified that the uninitiated
should perceive the nakedness of the land,
devoid of both food and fire; certainly he
received me unamiably, proffering only a foot
of raw beef sausage, and being sulky when I
declined it; informing me that it had been five
times the length, and all the remainder of the
guests had been very glad to eat it raw. When
I assured him, that although it might serve
his house to spare fuel, it by no means suited
me, he produced two shining slices of ham and
a piece of bread, the last in the house; he said
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_120' id='Page_120'>120</a></span>
he had sent to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Domo d’Ossola</span> for more, and
I returned in triumph to the eating-room, a
little <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marmiton</span> carrying the hot ham and dry
crust behind me. I found there several disconsolate
groups, and as companions in misfortune
we were in five minutes acquainted:
there were two American gentlemen, who
from their accent I thought Irish, and from
their kind politeness afterwards made me feel
that Mrs. Trollope’s recital was not always
fair; and an amiable English family, about to
turn back, the extortion of the Italians who in
the morning had asked 500f. for transporting
their carriage, now raising it to 1000. The
Americans had determined on going on,
though every one assured them it was wholly
impossible, and D—— said we might follow
where they went: so, having given our horses
proper repose, we mounted them again,—our
new acquaintances having the start of us by
about half an hour. For some distance the
road was good and smooth, the first awkward-looking
portion we approached being where it
bends backward like the coil of a snake, beyond
the village. The light carriage had passed; for
close to the edge of the precipice were the marks
left by its wheels, and as we led our horses over
we agreed that the damage had been probably
exaggerated, and we should want no guide.
The gallery of Algaby, 115 feet long,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_121' id='Page_121'>121</a></span>
conducted us from the more open space to the
gorge of Gondo. In 1814 it was converted to
a military post, and its entrance is half closed
by a wall, pierced with loopholes to defend the
pass. It is the most savage of stony glens:
no sunshine in its recesses, for the cliffs rise to
a height of more than 2200 feet; no vegetation,
except you can call such the broken line
of firs here and there seen on the tops of
the bare black crags, so nearly met overhead,
that</p>

<p class='c013' >their fragments lying in the stream, which
frets against and over them with a roar so
deafening, that we could not hear each other’s
voices; as sometimes (I speak for myself),
awed by the silence of all saving nature, we
rode along a narrower road, guarded only by
far severed granite posts, unconnected by pine
trunks, advancing like a cornice on the edge
of the rock and over the abyss,—proving, it is
true, that the work of man has been mighty;
but also showing, by the masses of crags scattered
like chaff, and the rush of unnumbered
waterfalls, which might bring destruction with
them from the mountain top, how easily his skill
may be baffled. Fanny’s sudden fright at one
of these had very nearly closed my journal:
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_122' id='Page_122'>122</a></span>
while, in consequence of her starts, Grizzle
placed outside as a bulwark, we were walking
our horses, a sharp turn brought us suddenly
on one of these cascades, bounding down a
cleft in the rock and crossing the road, she
swerved violently behind Grizzle and towards
the edge, which of course she did not see, as
her bright eye was fixed on the waterfall.
The curb-stone was slippery with the spray,
and we were within a foot of it; so close that
I said, “We are going over;” but at the same
time, from instinct, struck poor Fanny with
all my force, and the pain made her bound
forward, and pass the peril. D—— looked
pale and frightened, it being one of the cases
in which aid was impossible: I had not time
to be afraid. The <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ponte Alto,</span> a superb
bridge, which, with two enormous crags for
support, spans the Doveria, conducts the road
to its opposite shore. The still narrowing
gorge is at every step more deep sunken and
wild, almost resembling a cavern. We had
passed a break on the road of small consequence,
and had again commenced remarking
on Italian exaggeration, when we arrived at a
gap, some forty feet wide, cut by the rise of
the Doveria. Hid in it were a few men,
rather examining than repairing what would
have required fifty. To our surprise we saw
the marks of the carriage-wheels on the soft
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_123' id='Page_123'>123</a></span>
earth,—it had been dragged in and out again.
We led our horses down the steep, the men significantly
pointing to some holes through which
we might have sunk too far,—and Fanny,
whose rein I held, pulled me gallantly up on
the other side. At the wooden bridge which,
some steps farther, again traversed the torrent,
we found our American acquaintances,
tying up their pole which had broken there.
We exchanged a few words: on their side promises
of help, if help were needed, and thanks
on ours, and a portion of undamaged road led
us to the gallery of Gondo, 683 feet long,
(according to guide-books), blasted through
the rock, whose mass stood forth to bar
the way: the two vast apertures, made towards
the torrent, formerly lighted it but
feebly, but this was not the case to-day,—for
a part of its rocky roof and wall had been
carried away also. Issuing at its mouth, we
came, to my surprise, and not, considering my
late adventure, to my pleasure, on the bridge,
which immediately after crosses the superb
waterfall of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Frascinodi</span> thundering down its
immense volume from the high glacier, and
along the hollow of the cliff below the arch with
a spray which blinds and a roar which deafens,
falling into the deep gulf, where, struggling
among the crags, groans, as if in pain, the
Doveria.</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_124' id='Page_124'>124</a></span>
Having ridden down the abrupt descent
which immediately follows, ere the bending of
the road concealed this view, we turned to look
at it once more. It is that of which we have so
often seen drawings, the noblest in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Simplon</span>:
the graceful stone arch—the tall rocks
and the chasm—the fall and the torrent,—and
where the foam was not, the water in the basin
it has hollowed in the crag, of that pale clear
green seen in the crevices of a glacier.</p>

<p class='c010' >Before reaching the village of Gondo we
again passed the carriage, but were soon
stopped ourselves by a ruined piece of road
which, though dangerous to horses’ knees only,
was exceedingly embarrassing, as D—— could
not lead two; and I found that, even without
the care of Fanny, I was fully employed in
keeping my footing while scrambling up and
down the mounds of crag and loose stones, and
through the stream which, shrunk and quiet
now, had done this damage. I tried my skill
notwithstanding, and arrived at the top of the
first heap, whence Fanny refused either to slide
or jump into the water; and we were very
much in the situation of statues on a pedestal,
when our kind fellow-travellers arrived to my
aid, altering Fanny’s determination, and in
consequence Grizzle’s, who will not stir a step
unless she leads the way.</p>

<p class='c010' >The carriage was dragged over with a difficulty
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_125' id='Page_125'>125</a></span>
which several times made me fear that
our acquaintances and those with them would
have been forced along with it into the
Doveria: for it required the united strength of
all to preserve its equilibrium along the narrowed
way, now barely the width of its wheels.
It tottered several times on the slopes, and it
made me dizzy to see the men on the verge
opposing to its weight their own, where a false
step would have cast them below to be
mangled among the stones of the rapid torrent.
Another and worse obstacle waited us
at the entrance of Gondo: for here the stream,
which descended from the mountains, was still
three feet deep, and its violence made the
crossing it a work of danger; though with
the aid of our friends we accomplished it,
scrambling over piles of smooth rock and rolling
stones, and through the water. The carriage
was taken off its wheels, as no vehicle made
with human fingers could have passed here; and
the poor post-horses, who, no care bestowed on
them, had hitherto picked their own way,
could go no farther. We therefore proceeded
alone to Gondo, a melancholy village of a few
cabins and a chapel, and a strange building
of eight stories, with barred windows, which
I certainly should rather have supposed a
prison than an inn belonging to the family
of Stockalper. Could we have imagined that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_126' id='Page_126'>126</a></span>
it boasted common accommodation, as Artaria
assures it does, we should have remained there
to pass the night, being wet and weary; but
deceived as to its destination, we applied at an
inn some steps farther, and after screaming at
the entrance of the dark corridor till we had
roused every cur in the neighbourhood, a solitary
woman appeared, to say that this was not,
as we had fancied, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Isella</span>; that she had neither
bed for ourselves, nor food for our horses, and
we must go on, and should do well to make haste
as the evening was closing and there was a
“<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cattivo passo.</span>” Fortunately for us (our
friends being no longer within call) at the
frontier of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Valais</span> and Italy, where on the
left to mark it there is a humble chapel on the
crag, and on the right poised above the torrent
a colossal fragment of fallen rock, we found
some good-natured <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douaniers</span>, who assured us
of the impossibility of passing <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Isella</span>, and the
difficulty of even arriving there, and offered
to accompany us, a proposal we gladly
accepted as the evening was growing dusk,
and my hand was almost useless in leading
Fanny over such ground as we had been
treading.</p>

<p class='c010' >At this place, between the frontier and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Isella</span>,
on the 15th, the day of the storm, a carriage
was passing under the torrents of rain, and the
postilion, who, fortunately, was of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_127' id='Page_127'>127</a></span>
mountains and on his guard, walking at the heads
of his horses, saw above, symptoms of the
coming earth avalanche. He had time to shout
to the travellers to descend and to cut the
traces, when it came rushing down, the carriage
was swept into the Doveria with its luggage,
and instantly shattered to atoms: for the
largest remnant rescued, a portion of the
coach-box, was placed as a memento on a rock
by the road-side, and is hardly longer or
broader than a man’s hand.</p>

<p class='c010' >Our difficulties had now seriously begun.
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Isella</span> was in sight, but between it and us a
space of the road for about two hundred yards
had been swept away, leaving in its room piled
rocks and masses of stone, which had been its
foundation; a torrent, not very deep but furious
in its rapidity, was boiling down, crossing
these, and had already hollowed a bed
athwart the ruin. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douaniers</span> came up to
assist as we stopped in dismay and discouragement.
How the horses got over, and without
fall or stumble, is to me a matter of wonder;
they scrambled over the rocks and jumped
down descents, and struggled through the
water, and up the high mound of loose stones,
which yielded beneath their hoofs, doing
honour to their blood and race.</p>

<p class='c010' >I had been so completely wet before that,
but that the force of the stream was well nigh
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_128' id='Page_128'>128</a></span>
enough to lift me off my feet, I should have
preferred it to the plank thrown over by some
Samaritan.</p>

<p class='c010' >At <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Isella</span>, however, we were, passing the
custom-house, which I had hoped might be the
inn, being a building of decent exterior, to
arrive at the most miserable <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">auberge</span> ever
owned by even Italian masters: a wretched
shed on one side for stable, the sharp air blowing
in on our wet horses, no groom to dry
them, and filth for a bed; straw so rare, that
it was sold by the pound, at an inconceivable
price. A <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poste</span> of
“<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">carabinieri reali</span>” joined the
inn on the other side, and this was my consolation,
for while D—— was watching our poor
four-footed companions eat such hay and oats as
this place afforded, with apparent satisfaction,
I made my entry, mounting a ladder-like
stair which several Italians were descending,
one of whom held his candle in my face, as I
passed him on my way to the kitchen, where I
found (a red handkerchief tied above an
assassination-looking face) a most furious
Italian woman, distributing spirits, by the
light of one tallow candle, to a band of lawless
looking personages, who were shouting and
swearing.</p>

<p class='c010' >As nobody made way for me, I asked mine
hostess for a room, to which she said, “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Patienza;</span>”
and having assuaged the thirst of all
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_129' id='Page_129'>129</a></span>
her dark-faced customers, she set herself to
stirring a caldron full of some ill-scented
mixture on her hearth.</p>

<p class='c010' >On my applying for attention once more,
she said, with a toss of her head and spoon,
that I must wait, as she had not time to mind
me; and as I was really afraid of offending
her, I took a seat, which a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douanier</span> who was
smoking by the fire offered me by his side,
and sate close to him, placing my confidence
in his presence, and the vicinity of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">carabinieri.</span></p>

<p class='c010' >The turbulent party round my landlady
continued to drink and to smoke till I could
hardly see them through the cloud. As my
courage rose and the atmosphere grew stifling,
besides that I was weary of the Swiss Italian
of my companion, I got up to see if, till D—— should
have left his horses, I had, by passing
through the open door, a chance of more humanized
society, or at least of none. To my
extreme pleasure, on the balcony I found an
old French gentleman, with his son and grandson,
who had arrived some hours before ourselves.
They hailed the addition which we
and the Americans, who were on their way,
would make to their party, for the old man
said they had stopped only because they could
get no further, as he in his own person had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_130' id='Page_130'>130</a></span>
doubts of his hostess, and thought it would be
as well that we each should know the other’s
sleeping apartment, to afford help reciprocally,
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dans le cas,</span>” he added, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">que nous soyons
assassinés!</span>”</p>

<p class='c010' >His son was complaining bitterly of an
Italian <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">vetturino</span>, who, when on starting he
agreed for a certain sum to conduct his passengers
to Milan, already knew the state of
the road, as the 13th and 14th the storm
had been raging on the Italian side, though
its greatest fury was on the 15th. Under the
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kaltwasser</span> glaciers a sudden gust of wind
had overturned his carriage, absolutely on the
verge of the tremendous precipice. The poor
pale boy had shown great courage, and
even the horses and carriage received no
injury.</p>

<p class='c010' >Arrived at the first impediment beyond the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Simplon</span> inn, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voiturier</span> very truly asserted
he could go no farther, but also insisted on his
fare as far as Milan. The point had been referred
for arbitration to a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">juge de paix,</span> whose
interference the French gentleman demanded,
and the Italian consented to abide by; but
when the former arrived in his presence, he
found him washing dishes! He was an <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aubergiste,</span>
and unusually busy from the influx of
travellers, brought by untrue accounts of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_131' id='Page_131'>131</a></span>
road, given as far as <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vevay</span> by postilions and
innkeepers; of course he gave his verdict in
favour of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">vetturino</span>.</p>

<p class='c010' >D—— and the American gentlemen arrived
together, the carriage of the latter left
till morning at the other side of the broken
road, between it and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Isella</span>, where it had been
benighted, so that its imperials and portmanteaus
were carried over in the dark to undergo
the inspection of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douane.</span> The landlady
signified to me that it was now her pleasure
to conduct me to my chamber, therefore
with due docility I followed through the
kitchen, where the troop drinking at the long
table had been increased by those who aided
in the transport of Mr. C——’s carriage, and
up another break-neck flight, at the top of
which was a closet with two beds, over a part
of the before-named kitchen, therefore reaping
the full benefit of its merriment, and disputes,
and tobaccoed air.</p>

<p class='c010' >She first informed me, that one bed only
could be placed at my disposal, as other travellers
might arrive; and when I objected to
this arrangement, named with great coolness
the price she, as monarch of the mountain,
had assigned to it, it being her best apartment,
chosen <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">per respetto per me</span></i>. I said very
politely, being in awe of her, that I thought
her terms high, adding in the most amiable
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_132' id='Page_132'>132</a></span>
tone I could assume, that I had seen turn
back all the travellers now at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Simplon</span>,
and it was likely the inns would be ruined
along the road, as its reparation would not be
commenced till spring.</p>

<p class='c010' >In reply to this, she said she had no time
to listen to my conversation, and I had better
make my mind up; adding, I suppose by way
of aiding me in the effort, “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">E là il torrento;
si prende o si lascia,</span>”—“Take it or leave it,
there is the torrent;” and as this was very
true, I resigned myself, for there indeed was
the torrent, roaring below like a wild beast
before his fatal bound, and not only the torrent,
but no bridge, it had been swept away,
and there was none, barring a plank, as an
Irishman would say, which had been flung
slopingly across from rock to rock, high above
the Doveria, as a communication between the
inn and custom-house and the few hovels on
the opposite shore, which formed the rest of
the village of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Isella</span>.</p>

<p class='c010' >There were no stars, and the faint lights
which glimmered in a few of these cottages
were all I could distinguish through the darkness,
and the sound of the angry stream almost
covered the noise of the company below.
I asked my amiable companion for some hot
water, wishing to neutralize the effect of the
cold baths I had undergone to the ancle in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_133' id='Page_133'>133</a></span>
course of my day’s travel, to which she said,
“<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">A chè serve?</span>” and that she could not attend
to whims; and when my patience, long on the
wane, deserted me, sent me some by her
squinting brother, in a broken coffee cup, so
that seeing the remedy I had meditated was
not attainable, I drank it.</p>

<p class='c010' >Our next suffering was supper, and here
again we excited our hostess’s ire by ordering
eggs in the shell, as the only incorruptible
kind of food, instead of sharing the greasy liquid
and nameless ragouts which it pleased her to
serve up before our companions. Her ill-favoured
brother waited on us, the old French gentleman
asserting he looked like a wretch quite
ready to murder when his sister should have
robbed; an opinion which must have flattered
him if he understood French, but it was decided
he did not, though I thought he grew a
shade more hideous during the physiognomical
study. After regretting that all travelled
without arms, and determining to try any pass
in the morning rather than stay there, we
retired to our apartments. To obviate the
bad effects produced by the stifling size and
dirt of ours, I tried to admit the air, but the
casement was merely fixed in its place, and
had no hinges, so that having deranged its
economy, I had some trouble in restoring it
and keeping it fast by help of the broken
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_134' id='Page_134'>134</a></span>
chair. To speak the truth, I had intended to
lie awake till day, a design which I thought
the noise and the bad bed rendered easy to
accomplish, but fatigue was stronger than the
resolution, and after a few moments I forgot
that the door would not shut, lost the impression
of resting my feet on ground which gave
way under them, which had pursued me like
the motion of a ship after a voyage, and slept
far more soundly than I should have done in
my own bed and home. The Princess <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Bacciochi</span>
occupied this same chamber two days
before me—I pitied her.</p>

<p class='c010' >We were on our uncleaned horses at seven,
our kind hostess, with “a laughing devil in
her sneer,” asserting she should see us again,
and one or two of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carabiniers</span> smiling
confirmation of her hope of plunder. It was
a cold misty morning, and we started without
breakfast, there being nothing at the inn. I
believe the beauty of the scenery was almost
lost on us, yet <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Isella</span> is beautifully situated,
and the uniformity of crag and pine forest is
broken by the brighter green of fruit trees as
well as by masses of beech, which here clothe
the mountain. The gallery of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Isella</span>, a few
paces below the village, is picturesque in form
as in situation, for it is rather a deep archway,
and the jutting rock it traverses is supported
by a gigantic and naturally formed column.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_135' id='Page_135'>135</a></span>
Looking back, we could see <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Isella</span> and our
place of durance through the frame the dark
rock made. A bend in the road the next
moment concealed both, exhibiting an obstacle
at our feet which seemed fatal to further progress.
It was evident the Americans had
passed, but they had no horses with them, and
one of the thousand streams in which the
melted glacier had descended to swell the
Doveria had here brought down an avalanche
of stones, and piled them to form its banks.
The broken road before <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Isella</span>, though of
greater extent, was far less difficult of passage.
D—— with his grey got first over, and one
of the men, roused to good nature, advanced
to hold her while he returned for Fanny; but
I had half slipped, half jumped the descent
in search of the best mode of bringing her
without danger, and the little creature sprang
lightly down after me as if she had been on
her native turf. Grizzle was far less intelligent,
and difficult to lead through the foaming
water, but neither even stumbled. I got my
first footpath, increasing the sensation of
shivering, perhaps produced by starting in a
mountain fog with fast unbroken.</p>

<p class='c010' >We proceeded perhaps a hundred yards
without obstacle, followed by several <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cantonniers,</span>
telling us we went in vain, and a sudden
turn we again made proved it was indeed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_136' id='Page_136'>136</a></span>
hopeless, showing not now the remnant of a
road, but the place it had occupied, for not a
vestige remained—it was difficult to believe
it had been there. The length of this gap
was about half a mile. The Doveria had
partly changed her course, and left some distance
from her opposite bank dry; and dashing
against this with doubled violence, had formed
a wild bay inclosed, opposite us, by a far
advancing promontory, round whose foot the
road had circled, but which now rose perpendicularly
from the water; on this side, by the
same road, broken like a branch, and between
both swept angrily over the ruins, unwilling
its trophy should prove its barrier.</p>

<p class='c010' >Our American friends, whose carriage
waited here, about to be carried over piece-meal,
came up to consult with D——, and
leaving the horses in my charge, they set forth
together to inspect what might be done; for
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cantonnier en chef</span> offered to take his men
there, and construct a path three feet wide,
along which horses might be led before night:
it was now near nine o’clock, we had already
lost two hours.</p>

<p class='c010' >I watched D—— (having taken his first
plunge from the high ground we stood on to
the water) scramble through the foam and
rocks, clinging to, or climbing over them, here
ten to twelve feet high, and keeping near as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_137' id='Page_137'>137</a></span>
possible to shore on account of the depth and
strong current, crawl up the precipice to a
cottage which had been left unharmed, when
the earth cracked and fell from around and
under it. This, my companion the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cantonnier</span>
said, was easy to accomplish; the difficulties
were beyond, and, the path having traversed
the jutting point, they were henceforth invisible.
I sate on my horse employed in
fancying their nature, till I again saw D——
returning by his inconvenient footway, poising
himself on the slippery rocks, and arriving to
my surprise without limbs broken. Some of
the men had already gone to cut this path,
which was to be widened ere nightfall, but
D—— said it would be impossible to travel;
even supposing there should be a space of
three feet between the upright wall of earth
and the precipice, which goes down to the
Doveria, inasmuch as there was a rapid
descent, and where it ceased, a sharp turn, so
that a horse hurried down could scarcely fail
to be precipitated into the torrent.</p>

<p class='c010' >One of the ruined spaces we had already
traversed, a German gentleman with his lady,
and a guide leading her mule, had attempted
to pass on the 18th, a day before ourselves.
The animal slipped on the verge, and the
guide, in his effort to save the lady, was
dragged over also. Her body, for she was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_138' id='Page_138'>138</a></span>
killed on the spot, was recovered and carried
to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Isella</span>, that of the unfortunate man was
swept away. This was a warning; we proposed
to ford the torrent, thus circling round
the base of the mountain where it was shallow,
but the men, whose aid we demanded, treated
the idea as madness, and refused positively,
we therefore paid the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cantonnier</span> en chef for
his trouble, and turned our horses’ heads
towards the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Simplon</span> inn; for, discouraging as
it was to seek again obstacles once surmounted,
to do so seemed the one thing possible. As
we turned, disconsolately thinking of the
wearisome valley of the Rhone, and the long
detour we must make by Geneva, a young
officer of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">carabinieri,</span> with whom we had been
in conversation before, and a priest, came up
to accost us. There was a way, he said, which
might be just passable, over the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Trasquiera</span>,
he had gone it once in search of deserters;
but a guide to lead Fanny was indispensable,
and none was to be had. Chance served us
well, for as we were looking about with but
faint hope of seeing one, (all the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cantonniers</span>
being gone to their work a mile away, and no
one walking there for pleasure,) came up a
young man, to whom the kind priest immediately
applied, asking him for what recompense
he would accompany us across the
mountain, and to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Domo d’Ossola</span>: he said seven
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_139' id='Page_139'>139</a></span>
francs, but that he did not know the way; and
our embarrassments would have recommenced,
but that the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Paroco</span> summoned his young
brother, a pretty slight boy of twelve, who
knew all the paths and precipices within five
miles round. The <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Trasquiera</span> almost hangs
over <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Isella</span>, and the zigzag path up its side
commences from the broken road we had
crossed after leaving the village that morning.
Over this our poor horses were led again, and
bidding good bye to the priest and officer, we
commenced our ascent, the boy leading the
way, Fanny climbing like a goat and pulling
up the guide, who, having never touched
a horse’s rein before, rather hung by it than
was of service; D—— supporting Grizzle,
who was very frightened and awkward, and I
bringing up the rear, and though they were
obliged to pause every ten steps for breath,
often at a distance; as the weight of my habit
encumbered me, and this path is not even
used by mules, and by the country people
rarely to drive their cattle to the pastures, as
there is a better on the other side the mountain.
For the first five minutes we went on
trusting it would improve; after the first
quarter of hour, because to turn became
almost impossible, the track being at no part
more than two feet broad, and winding in
zigzags along the extreme verge above a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_140' id='Page_140'>140</a></span>
torrent, which, though neither so broad nor
deep as the Doveria, would, as <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Mercutio</span> said,
“serve,” and besides formed like an irregular
stair of steps of stone two and three feet high,
small and pointed, broad and smooth. I often
used hands as well as feet, catching at rocks
and roots. Poor Grizzle went sorely against
her will; only the boy and Fanny, who were
far a-head, seemed to enjoy it.</p>

<p class='c010' >As the road grew steeper and I found I
must have both hands free, I took off the skirt
of my habit and laid it over the latter’s saddle,
thinking at the time I never saw a prettier
object than her little thorough bred form in
the guise of a packhorse, but stepping on with
a demeanour as dignified as if she had been
at a review in the Champ de Mars. The
path now became absolutely vertical, and the
more difficult from its being over smooth
loose ground. As we had dined lightly the
day before and not breakfasted this, even on
a cup of water, I have perhaps an excuse for
the giddiness and fear produced by exhaustion,
which took momentary possession of me, and
certainly brought with them my only real
danger, for worn out by the scorching heat
and harassing walk, I felt unable to climb
higher, too giddy to look back, and unable to
sit down, as the ground from its excessive
slope afforded no support, and I was afraid of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_141' id='Page_141'>141</a></span>
slipping in a minute from the height I had
passed three hours in attaining. I believe I
was going to scream, but I thought better of
it, and seized a pine branch and arrived at the
stones and safer ground before D——, who
had therefore left Grizzle to her fate, could
arrive to help me. Here was the first chalet,
but it was locked, left by its owners, who were
gone to the high pastures, and we were disappointed
in our hoped for draught of water.
There was a spring, the boy said, half an hour’s
walk farther, so we rested a few minutes and
then went on patiently, though it was twelve
o’clock and we were parched with thirst, and
mountain air, renovating as it is, will not
supply the place of all things. We were now
in a tract of pine forest, and at its steepest
part found our way barred by half a-dozen
Italian woodcutters, who were felling the
trees, one of which lay across our path. D——
said afterwards he expected a worse adventure
here, for we had a large sum in gold
about us, and the odds were in their favour,
besides that the ground was of such nature,
that a push would have been sufficient to
settle matters without trouble. The Italians
were, however, better than their countenances;
they opened their dark eyes wider in wonder
at the apparition of English horses there, but
dragged aside the pine; and when I, who had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_142' id='Page_142'>142</a></span>
struck my foot against some roots and could get
no farther, called to them to give me “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">la mano,</span>”
good naturedly pulled me up, each consigning
me to the broad black hand of his comrade,
so that I arrived at the summit of the mound
with more ease than accompanied my climbings
heretofore. After this followed a few
steps of what the guide denominated plain.
The direction of our road had changed, and
now too high above the unseen Doveria to
hear its roar, we looked through vistas of
pines to those of the mountains on its opposite
bank, seeming a continuation of these
forests without a symptom of the abyss between.
We toiled on some time longer,
D—— casting back at me looks of pity, and
I trying to smile, though I should have been
puzzled to say for what. We found too juniper
berries and hips and haws, and shared them
after the manner of the babes in the wood,
but the delight was the spring, at which we
arrived at last, trickling from a rock. D——
bent the top of his hat into a hollow, and out
of this cup we drank, I do not know how
many draughts, but certainly the best in our
lives; for my own part the relief it afforded
seemed to dispel all fatigue, and we went on
merrily, though our path lay across the bed of
a torrent, which, though hardly flowing, had
still sufficient water to make slippery its
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_143' id='Page_143'>143</a></span>
smooth shelving stones, polished like marble
by its passage.</p>

<p class='c010' >The ascent continued, but it was no longer
rapid, and half an hour brought us on the
mountain pastures at the summit, and among
the chalets. We saw nobody; the priest’s
brother said it was not the hour for finding
milk, so there was nothing to be done but to
lie down on the short fine grass, irrigated by a
hundred rills, and let the horses drink from
them, and drink ourselves out of the palm
of our hands. The guide murmured for the
fiftieth time “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">paese del Diavolo,</span>” and the
boy laughed at me. Though he had knocked
at one of these habitations and found no one, he
was fortunately wrong as to the absence of all,
and the wondrous sight we indeed constituted
there, attracted some of the half wild mountain
women, good looking and picturesquely
attired with bright kerchiefs on their heads,
and cloth leggings instead of stockings on their
feet, coarse brown jackets and blue cloth
petticoats with a deep crimson border.</p>

<p class='c010' >The first who issued from the dwelling
seeing the perseverance with which I drank out
of my hand from the mountain stream, came
smiling to offer a long ladle, which was an
admirable substitute. An old woman seeing,
I suppose, that I looked pale and faint, plunged
her hand into a long pocket and drew forth
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_144' id='Page_144'>144</a></span>
two apples. We accepted them with great
gratitude, and asked if we could get some
milk; it really was not the hour, but several of
the good natured creatures set forth different
ways in search, and our first benefactress, who
had left us for a moment, returned, this time
her apron quite full of the small sweet apples,
and with her half a dozen companions came
close to watch us eat them, and say “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">povero</span>”
and “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">poverina</span>” every minute. They asked
the guide and the boy fifty questions without
obtaining satisfactory answers, for they spoke
a patois, which neither clearly comprehended.
For my own part, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe’s</span> Swiss Italian
was bad enough; the boy spoke purely, for he
was from the shores of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lago Maggiore,</span>
but of this not a word in ten was intelligible
to me. I understood, however, that the horses
were even more than ourselves the objects of
their curiosity. Their admiration was unwearied;
they walked round them and clapped
their hands, and laughed to see them eat and
drink, repeating some of the few Italian words
they knew, “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Oh la bella bestia, la bella bestia,</span>”
and that they had never seen a horse before.
How far this is possible to people, who, though
on a mountain, are but three hours removed
from the most frequented road in Europe, I
leave you to decide. The guide confirmed it; the
women, he said, were employed all the summer
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_145' id='Page_145'>145</a></span>
on the pastures and in making cheese, which
the men carried for sale below, and in the
season when the snows fell, which at this height
happens early, they spun their own wool and
lived inclosed in their mountain village. Certainly
the men were less primitive in their
manners than the women, and also less prepossessing
in appearance. Several, when the
females gone in search of milk returned, came
in their company inspecting us with less
merriment but more attention. We began
to think it would be unwise to be benighted
on the mountain, and paying the good women
for our breakfast in a way they thought
splendid, I mounted Fanny for the five minutes
during which the plain lasted, and was
hardly on her back, when she thought proper
to leap a stream, through which I should have
preferred her walking quietly. Whether or no
the mountain women had ever seen a horse
before, I doubt they will ever see one leap
that rivulet again. At the next we reached, for
they are innumerable, Grizzle, whom D——
was still leading, following her comrade’s example,
but as usual in the wrong place,
jumped it with great energy, knocking her
master down.</p>

<p class='c010' >A bad path and steep ascent led hence to
another meadow, where Grizzle was in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_146' id='Page_146'>146</a></span>
jeopardy, for her saddle, valise, and all, turning,
she was so frightened as to start away from
D——, who had quitted her bridle to arrange
them, and towards the bushes on the verge,
where she would have rolled over, for the
meadow was a mere platform, with precipices
all round it. We saved her by an appeal to
her greediness: she stopped short to eat the
clover I gathered for the purpose. Met here
an old man, who asked the guide whence we
came, and said, in reply, “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Non scenderanno
mai,</span>” which was encouraging. Continuing
to ascend, we were on the summit in half an
hour more, in presence of the miserable village
and desert inn. No one is there save on fête
days, the boy said. We sate under the shed
which is its appurtenance, on the stone seat
which surrounds the stone table. A few steps
further, on the mountain’s very verge, is the
small church, painted and ornamented, and
here the priest’s brother left us, delighted
with his fee, as the descent began at this
spot, whence the mule-path winds to the
valley. For a few minutes it appeared more
promising, but for a few minutes only, for
though cut in broader zigzags and its precipices
less appalling, it was still but four feet
wide, and its steep steps of loose stone made
Grizzle groan with fear as she slipped down
them, her head in the air, and her feet thrown
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_147' id='Page_147'>147</a></span>
forward most helplessly. It would have been
impossible to lead her, but that Fanny was
first, hurrying gaily forward, and picking her
steps like a mule,—the guide said, “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Va
d’incanto.</span>” The rain had commenced falling
as we passed the church, a circumstance we
were too busy to notice: it was at all events
preferable to the overpowering sun, whose
heat we had suffered. Arrived at the bottom,
under the shelter of some noble chestnut trees,
an improvement after brushwood and barrenness,
there is a hamlet under the wall of rock,
and before it and us, the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Querasca,</span> which
joined the Doveria a stone’s throw further.
Our guide had sought this spot for the sake
of its wooden bridge, left unharmed when the
storm swept away that of stone.</p>

<p class='c010' >Arrived at the torrent’s edge, and looking
about in vain, he asked a peasant girl to conduct
him thither, but it had disappeared also,
carried down the current the day after its
comrade. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span> never despaired—we had
done so during this expedition twenty times
over,—but all he said was “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adesso vedremo;</span>”
and now, the wooden bridge being wholly
invisible, we went on to the high road opposite
the ruin of the other and the avalanche of
stones occupying the place of a farm which
had been carried away, and stood under the
pouring rain on the brink of the torrent,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_148' id='Page_148'>148</a></span>
which this time had changed its course in its
fury, leaving the one arch which remained
standing an island. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span> said the same
thing. With the calm blue eye of a northern,
he was in all things a contrast to the Italians
we had met hitherto; for his courage was
always quiet and ready, and he never tried to
enhance his services, and in the most difficult
moments looked round with an encouraging
smile on his good-natured face. If ever I
pass through <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Crevola</span> again, I will look for
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe Sala.</span> On our side the gulf, and on
the commencement of the vanished bridge,
were standing about a dozen Italians, not at
work, but in contemplation; and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span>,
brave fellow as he was, after looking a moment
at the turbid water, intimated his intention of
fording it. We desired him to employ one or
two of these to assist him in crossing. The
ill-looking idlers came crowding round in
consequence, talking fast and loud; “they did
increase the storm,” but insisted on it, that if
one were hired all must be, and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span>
gently said, “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Io solo,</span>” and walked into the
water with Fanny. The torrent was broad,
and, though not more than four feet deep,
fearfully rapid, and only by clinging to her
he got safe over, though not without extremely
alarming us, for in its very centre, where it
rushed most furiously among the masses of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_149' id='Page_149'>149</a></span>
stone, she stopped to drink, and we almost
expected to see both swept away. As they
turned the opposite point of land, we lost sight
of them, but were soon reassured by Fanny’s
violent screamings for her comrade, and the
sight of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span>, very wet and triumphant,
running back to us along the pine trunk flung
from the high ground to the shore. He had
less trouble with Grizzle, for it had become
impossible to hold her, and in her impatience
to join her comrade, she rushed through rocks
and water, dragging him along without any
effort of his own. Our turn was now come,
and we were to cross the pine trunk, which,
considered an easy comfortable bridge in the
mountains, made me giddy to look at. I
believe we both would have preferred the
water, but necessity makes the head steady,
and shame prevented our hesitation, for an
old woman crossed it before us, composedly,
as if it had been a meadow, with a pile of
faggots on her back for ballast, and her bare
feet clinging to the asperities of the bark,
wherein she had an advantage over us. I
called to her from the other side to hold out
her hand, but the poor soul returned the
whole length and then walked it backwards,
leading and nodding to me, with the stream
flowing ten feet below, and when I wanted to
pay her, ran away and over it once more.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_150' id='Page_150'>150</a></span>
D—— arrived, marshalled by a boy, and we
found the horses waiting: Fanny held by a
youth, who complained of having lost in the
water, which he had not entered, shoes never
made for him. The rain had fallen during
two hours without interruption, and now gave
place to scorching sun once more. Ere we
rode on, we looked up at the little church on
the summit of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Trasquiera</span>, in wonder that
our horses had been there, but our hour of
tranquillity was not yet come, and a very short
distance brought us to an obstacle impassable
as at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Isella</span>, and resembling it closely, for there
was picturesque confusion in place of the road,
of which no vestige remained, and a tongue of
high land, round which foamed the Doveria.
Here, however, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span> knew his road, and
led among vineyards, by ways we should have
thought steep and bad at other times, to a
picturesque village—it must have been Dovedro—and
thence across the dry bed of a
stream, and under long arcades of the trellised
vine. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span> gathered grapes for us, for
which (in poetical justice) we paid a woman
carrying a sickly child, to whom they did not
belong.</p>

<p class='c010' >Further on our way, for we made a round
of a mile, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span> and the horses fording
another tributary torrent, and ourselves passing
it partly on a plank, partly by wading
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_151' id='Page_151'>151</a></span>
through, we arrived at and kept the high road,
crossing breaks innumerable—none so important
as to force us aside, though elsewhere
I would have ridden twenty miles to avoid one
of them.</p>

<p class='c010' >The last gallery was that of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Crevola</span>, cut
for the length of one hundred and seventy
feet, in a straight line, through the solid rock.
The scenery had lost its naked horror, and
grown beautiful as well as grand; trees
fringing, far below the road, the banks of the
deep torrent; and, as we ascended the hill,
we passed on our right hand, prostrate on our
way, and expressive in its silence, a broken
column, once on its road to be a monument of
Napoleon’s glory. From the summit of this
hill we had a noble view of the high bridge
of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Crevola</span>, over which we were to pass, and
to which the road descends gradually; its two
arches rest on a pillar one hundred feet high,
and beneath them the Doveria utters its dying
roar, and spends its last fury in its encounter
with the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tosa.</span></p>

<p class='c010' >Having crossed this bridge, we were out of
the Val Doveria and in that of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tosa</span>,
trellised vineyards covering the slopes to the
right, the broad river flowing along its centre,
and on the left, gentler mountains, with green
woods dotted with villas, and the high white
campanile rising each above its village. Still,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_152' id='Page_152'>152</a></span>
after the descriptions I have read of this valley,
its aspect disappointed me. It was a relief from
contrast certainly, to ride along a level, and
unaccompanied by the roar of the torrent, and
our previous fatigue might perhaps indispose
us to admire what beauty it really possesses,
or it might be saddened by the mists of that
dull evening. To me it had a look of desolation,
for the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tosa</span>, which had swollen and now
shrunk again, had left a broad track of sand
and stone through the ravaged meadows; and
a short distance from <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Domo</span> we found a sign
and token of its power, for the fine stone bridge
was carried away, and, for the convenience of
foot-passengers, a plank, sloping considerably,
had been laid from the high remnant, on the
one side, to the ground, where there was no
vestige, on the other. On the right of this
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ci-devant</span> bridge, the ravaged space extended
wide and far, the river still flowing in its centre.
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span> said, “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Adesso vedremo,</span>” and
ran down to seek a fitting place for crossing
with the horses, for it seemed, to the left of the
bridge, so deep and broad as to give little hope
of finding a ford. An Italian lady and gentleman
had, however, driven from <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Crevola</span>
before us, I suppose to see the state of the
route, and good-naturedly recalled our guide,
saying, the only possible place was there. The
sun had long been set, and the brief twilight
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_153' id='Page_153'>153</a></span>
was fading also, so that we had no time to
lose. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span> went in without hesitation,
this time above the waist. I watched him in
fear, for though there were now no rocks in his
way, the strength of the current was such as,
but for clinging to the horses, he could not
have mastered. This was our last impediment,
and we arrived at dark at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Domo d’Ossola</span>; it
was well for our vanity that we made our entry
then, D——’s hat, which had served, as I
told you, for tea-cup, and my tattered boots
and muddy habit, looking unlike the garb of
conquerors such as we considered ourselves to
be. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span> took leave of us in the yard of
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">la Posta.</span> I had asked him to conduct us to
the best hotel, to which he said, “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Son tutti
ladri, ma è questo un buon ladro.</span>” He had
not thought of increasing his demand, and
looked surprised at receiving gold and a
supper. The horses had a good stable and
wondrous appetite, Fanny rolling ever and
anon, and recommencing with fresh energy.</p>

<p class='c010' >A knock at the door of our apartment
announced our amiable American friends
(whose carriage had been carried over), come
to congratulate us on our safety. Our dinner
was served about ten, and very acceptable as
the first meal during the day. We shall remain
a day or two, for the inn is comfortable
and, as the hand-book observes, clean as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_154' id='Page_154'>154</a></span>
Italian hotels usually are. I should prefer
bright rubbed floors to the matting which
covers these, and seems seldom or never swept,
but the cabin at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Isella</span> is a good foil for all
that may follow.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>21st September.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Rain from dawn to sunset, and now a terrific
thunder-storm, more disconsolate travellers
arrived on foot or in <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chaises à porteurs</span></i>;
carriages left perforce at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Simplon</span>.</p>

<p class='c010' >Prince William of Prussia, the king’s second
son, just now driven into the yard with his
princess, and in a cart; they slept last night at
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Isella</span>. They have been in an amusing dilemma;
for by some mistake he had no passport,
and was in consequence about to be
detained, as he is travelling <i>incognito</i>, when
being a remarkable looking soldier-like man,
he was recognized by one of the authorities.
We were agreeably surprised by the apparition
of our comrade of the Simmenthal, who
has just been to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bex,</span> hoping to find a battle
there, and as the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Valaisans</span> are more talkative
than terrible, and he heard the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Simplon</span> road
was broken, came on to see its damages, and
good naturedly to look for us here. Our
friend Mr. H—— and his family are at the

<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Simplon</span> waiting till the road shall be so far
repaired as to render the carrying over of their
heavy carriages possible; we hope to meet
them at Florence.</p>

<p class='c009' >Once more not “upon the waters” but on
the road, though indeed I need not have
changed the quotation, since at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vogogna</span> there
is no bridge. Leaving <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Domo</span>, the road runs
in a straight and even line along the valley
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_157' id='Page_157'>157</a></span>
and between the wooded mountains, the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Simplon</span> and its snow closing the glen behind
us. The vine, so unsightly in France, here
confers great beauty, rising from the road in
terraces of shady arbours, or winding its
flexible branches round cherry-tree and thorn,
the long untrained tendrils waving gracefully,
and the rich bunches hung heavily down.
We passed, ere we reached <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vogogna</span>, which is
six miles from <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Domo d’Ossola</span>, several tracts
of land ruined by the late overflow; meadows
covered with mud, and Indian corn decaying
on the stalk. “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ha tutto rovinato,</span>” said a
poor woman, who was mournfully gazing at
her field of rotting corn. Arrived at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vogogna</span>,
the ferry-boat was on the opposite side, and
on ours, waiting to be transported thither,
were troops of horned cattle lying on the
sand, and an English carriage. Seeing there
was small chance of speedy removal, as we
could distinguish on the other side a most
obstinate cow, who was first to be deposited
on ours, we dismounted to sit patiently on the
crags scattered about us, left probably by the
Anza, which joins the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tosa</span>, here rushing down
through the valley of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Anzasca,</span> whose opening
lay behind us, and from its source in the
glaciers of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Monte Rosa.</span> The stonework,
whence sprung the bridge which once transported
travellers to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vogogna</span>, remains on each
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_158' id='Page_158'>158</a></span>
side the river, but the bridge carried away in
1834, Italian indolence leaves unreplaced;
substituting the worst of ferry-boats, small
and without barriers. The English gentleman,
the inhabitant of the carriage, had
got out with his daughter, and come near to
admire Fanny and kindly yield his turn to us.
Our horses started at their unusual conveyance
when led on board, particularly mine,
who we feared would spring into the water,
but our good natured countryman insisting on
lending his assistance, the difficulty seemed
surmounted, till we found that the two boatmen,
who had contentedly ferried across one
cow, were now preparing to drive six oxen on
board, an addition which, from the size of the
boat, if it did not frighten, was likely to force
our horses over. We fortunately comprehended
that there was an alternative, and having
before paid the fare, gave three times the
sum for <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">buona mano</span></i>, and were allowed to cross
without them.</p>

<p class='c010' >This had been a long delay, and to redeem
lost time we cantered along, leaving behind
vines and wood and much of the road’s
beauty, substituting marsh and bare mountain.
Arrived at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Fariolo</span> we found compensation,
for it is the first village on the lake
border, and the lake, blue and glassy, soothing
in its calm and silence, was beautiful beyond
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_159' id='Page_159'>159</a></span>
description. There is here an inn which appears
a good one, and had been recommended to us
by the master of that of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Domo</span>, but the stage
would have been too short.</p>

<p class='c010' >The first visible of the Borromean islands
is the green and lovely <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Isola Madre</span>, backed
by bold mountains, opening and receding to
admit the lake which stretches between them,
completing its length of fifty-four miles, for
the portion along which we were riding forms
its west arm only; broken crags and wooded
promontories, crowned by church, convent, and
castle, bounded the shore opposite and parallel
to our broad road carried under cliffs and
green hills, their abrupt sides covered with
graceful vineyards, and their summit shaded
by luxuriant oak and sweet chestnut. We
were disturbed in our admiration only by
swarms of flies, which made our horses kick
violently; I personally, by a half fear of the
bright water, along whose edge this noble
causeway has been made, sometimes rising
many feet above its level, and here, as at the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Simplon</span>, the only obstacle between it and my
starting little steed, low granite posts unconnected
and far apart. We passed the
quarries of pink granite which take so high a
polish, and arrived at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Baveno,</span> but it was
early still, and the innkeeper has at present
a character for being both dear and insolent,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_160' id='Page_160'>160</a></span>
while his house has one for dirt; it is a pity,
for it is well situated, with only the road and
some fine trees between it and the lake. This
is the person, who, having fleeced unmercifully
an English party we met at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vevay</span>, said
in reply to a remonstrance, “What the prices
of Milan, or of any other place may be, I
never inquire; these are mine!” so having
walked our horses towards the inn whence
this dignitary had issued at our approach
with a self-satisfied air and two waiters, we
cantered by, though the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Monte Monterone</span>
rises behind the village, commanding from its
summit a view of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lago de Orta</span> on one
side, and of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lago Maggiore</span> on the other;
we were yet too fresh from a mountain pass to
desire a second. I more regretted wanting
time to visit the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Isola Bella</span>, distant but a
twenty-five minutes’ row from this spot, but it
looks perhaps to more advantage seen from the
shore, its ten amphitheatrical terraces rising
green and glowing with its orange and citron
forests from the bosom of the blue water; and
the lake supporting it gently, and smiling to
reflect it, as if it were proud of its presence, and
bare its exotic carefully. On the northern
side of the island, that nearest <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Baveno,</span> the
still unfinished palace rises abruptly from the
lake, as do the inn and a few poor dwellings
almost by its side. Beyond them is a grove
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_161' id='Page_161'>161</a></span>
of laurel and myrtle and the hardier shrubs,
this exposition not being favourable to all, for
the terraced gardens have a southerly aspect,
and it is there that the aloes and camphor
tree and cactus grow, with the Alps looking
down on them, as if in their own tropical soil.
This was a barren slate rock. Here, as well as
on the other islands, naked crags also, was the
now fruitful earth transported by human
labour in 1670, by order of Count <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vitaliano
Borromeo,</span> whose descendant still makes the
palace his summer residence. Perhaps the
hand of art is too visible, and the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Isola Bella</span>
less striking from its individual beauty than
its glorious position; but if not deserving the
exaggerated praise of some, it still less merits
the contempt of others. I prefer indeed the
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Isola Madre</span>; for its forest of laurel, cypress
and gigantic pine, though planted on a made
soil also, grows in the wild beauty of nature,
sheltering exotic birds, which live and multiply
in freedom, and the plants of southern
climes flourishing in the open air.</p>

<p class='c010' >We could distinguish the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Isolino,</span> the smallest
of these islands, nestling under the promontory
of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pallanza.</span> The <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Isola Pescatore</span> lies
near the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Isola Bella</span>, like the beggar at the
rich man’s gate, covered with the dirty hovels
of the fishermen, and without a green leaf to
enliven it. We rode on, viewing them only
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_162' id='Page_162'>162</a></span>
from the shore, though on the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Isola Bella</span> is
the bay-tree bearing the word <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Battaglia</span>,
carved by Napoleon’s knife shortly before the
battle of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marengo</span>. The road continued to
skirt the lake, raised high above its waters,
crossing a fine bridge over a torrent, and
passing through <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Stresa,</span> where boats may be
hired to visit the islands, and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Belgirate</span> with
its villas and terraces of flowers. The sun
set as we rode through the last, and though
the cool evening air was a relief, and the
Swiss lakes sink into mediocrity beside the
beauty of this, the loneliness of the road
caused by the broken <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Simplon</span> made me
anxious to arrive ere nightfall; but the distance
at which we saw <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Arona</span>, built at the
promontory’s foot, and the long curve of the
road to arrive there, soon proved that this was
impossible, though, at the first glimpse, the
extreme clearness of the atmosphere deceives
as to space. I was glad, as the sky darkened,
to meet custom-house officers on the look out
for smugglers. Pleasure-boats and fishing-smacks
were silently moving along the water,
wanting the neatness and gaiety of those of
Geneva, but manned by most picturesque
forms. My first impression of Italian beauty
was a favourable one, for from <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Domo d’Ossola</span>
to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Arona</span> I hardly saw one peasant not handsome.
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Arona</span> is picturesquely situated, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_163' id='Page_163'>163</a></span>
spire of its church towering high above the
old houses which descend to the water’s edge,
and the whitening remains of the ruined castle
in which St. Charles of Borromeo was born
covering the tall crag which commands the
town. On the summit of the hill, ere arriving
at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Arona</span>, we could distinguish St. Charles’s
statue looking black against the glowing sky,
but having little effect at that distance, though
it is sixty-six feet in height, and its pedestal
forty-four; neither did I think the attitude
good; one hand holds a breviary, the other is
extended to bless the place of his birth, but
the arm seems cramped. It had become quite
dark, and the road rather unsafe, for it is
narrower and higher above the lake. The full
moon was rising slowly from behind the hill
of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Angera</span> opposite us, showing herself above
the ruined castle which surmounts it, and
resting on its towers like a glory. The castle
and village once belonged to the dukes of
Milan, and in the deserted halls are still some
fresco paintings, commemorating events of the
life of Archbishop <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Otho Visconti</span>. There was
just sufficient cloud in the sky to make its
blue seem more bright and pure, and the reflection
of the moon which crossed the lake to
our feet danced so dazzlingly that the eye
pained to watch it. We had some trouble in
forcing the horses past a lime-kiln. The strong
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_164' id='Page_164'>164</a></span>
light flung across the road mingling with the
moonbeam, and falling on the fine dark faces
of the Italians who stood near; the ruin and
that sky and water, made a picture for <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vernet.</span>
I dare say we shall never forget the moon
rising over the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lago Maggiore.</span> We found
our way to the inn with difficulty, through
narrow streets of lofty houses, into which the
moonlight could not penetrate; and as <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Arona</span>
boasts no lamps, would have been wholly
dark but for the lights glimmering from the
windows to make their crookedness visible.</p>

<p class='c010' ><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Posta</span> is clean, its owners civil, and
dinners good, but the nakedness of Italian
rooms is melancholy. In France, even in an
humble inn, you will find the mirror over the
chimney, with the clock and vases of gaudy
flowers to decorate it, and a comfortable chair,
and curtains to bed and window; but here the
iron bedstead has none, the chimney has no
looking-glass, one or two upright straw chairs
and a deal table only on the dirty brick floor;
and looking from the furniture to the plastered
walls, it is difficult not to fancy oneself either
in the cell of a prison or the ward of an hospital.
I must say in <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Posta’s</span> favour, that all
the apartments to the lake, which are the best,
were already occupied when we arrived, so
that having dined and passed half an hour at
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_165' id='Page_165'>165</a></span>
the window of the corridor behind our rooms,
looking out on its beauty, I proceeded to my
deal table and the contemplation of the Life of
San Carlo Borromeo. Pursuing my old habit
of borrowing a book to summon sleep, I am
likely to read through a strange library. The
colossal statue is but half an hour’s walk from
the inn: the head, hands, and feet only, are of
bronze, the drapery composed of sheets of
beaten copper, supported within by a species
of stone pyramid, crossed by bars of iron, which
defend it from the violence of the winds. It
is possible to clamber up in the dark, making
these serve for ladder, first entering by an
aperture between the folds of the robe; but
as the promenade would be impossible for a
lady, and the temptation to sit in the saint’s
nose was not strong enough to attract D——,
we neither made a pilgrimage to his shrine,
contenting ourselves with his history.</p>

<p class='c010' >Know then that he was born in 1538, in that
ruined castle on the crag, the mild child of
pious parents, enthusiastic from his infancy,
passing his hours of recreation in the castle
chapel, alone and in prayer—when taken
from a life of contemplation, which might have
weakened his intellects, studying with none of
the relaxations of his age at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pavia</span> and Milan—at
twelve years old provided with a rich
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_166' id='Page_166'>166</a></span>
abbey, whose possession was hereditary in his
family; and soon after, the Cardinal De’ Medici,
his uncle, becoming Pope <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pius</span> the Fourth, he
ceded to him a second and a priory. His
elder brother dying in 1562, and his family in
consequence beseeching him to abandon the
profession to which he was yet unbound,
and marry for the sake of his ancient line,
to extinguish at once their hopes of his
doing so, he entered into holy orders and was
ordained bishop. It is strange that, before
this and his brother’s death, he wore the
purple as cardinal at the age of three-and-twenty;
occupied divers posts of importance;
taking part in the temporal government of the
pope’s states as well as in the affairs of the
church, protecting letters, and establishing an
academy at the Vatican. His biographer says
he communicated to <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pius</span> the Fourth, infirm
and feeble, the energy so needful to him; gave
the impulse wanting to the deliberation of the
Council of Trent, and prosecuted the reform
of the catholic church, so necessary in his time.
At the Roman court he had lived in splendour,
but obtaining in 1565 the papal permission to
reside in his diocese, he practised in his own
house a reform and austerity unlikely to find
imitators. He condemned himself to perpetual
abstinence and long fasts; gave up his other
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_167' id='Page_167'>167</a></span>
benefices, and resigned his inheritance to his
family; divided the revenues of his archbishopric
into three portions—the first for the
poor, the second for the wants of the church,
the third for his own, and of the employment
of this last rendered up a strict account in his
provincial councils.</p>

<p class='c010' >Having found the diocese of Milan in a most
deplorable state from the negligence, ignorance,
and scandalous conduct of the clergy,
he so toiled to produce a better state of things
that, despite his patience and charity, his
enemies among the religious orders, which had
shaken off all subordination, were virulent;
and many and foremost of these, as it had
hitherto been most shameless and irregular,
was that of the “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Umiliati</span>.” One day, during
mass, while the prelate prayed with his whole
household in his archiepiscopal chapel, and at
the moment that the anthem “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non turbetur
cor,</span>” &amp;c., was commenced, a brother of the
order, named Farina, who had taken his post,
seemingly in prayer also, at the entrance of
the chapel, but five or six paces distant from
St. Charles, who was kneeling before the altar,
fired his harquebuss at him. The chant
ceased, the consternation was general, but the
saint, notwithstanding that he believed himself
mortally wounded, made a sign that the service
should continue. Rising up when the prayer
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_168' id='Page_168'>168</a></span>
was done, the ball, which had deposited itself
in his robe, fell at his feet!!! The assassin,
and three monks, his accomplices, were punished
with death, though against St. Charles’s will;
and their order, which had existed from the
eleventh century, was abolished by a bull of
Pope <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pius</span> the Fifth, and the archbishop employed
its confiscated revenues in founding
colleges and hospitals. The event which best
proves him worthy of his reputation was the
breaking out of the plague at Milan. He
had been on a visit to a distant part of his
diocese, and on the receipt of the fatal news,
notwithstanding the advice of his council, he
hurried back, and during the six months
through which it lasted, sought fearlessly contagion
where it existed in greatest violence,
administered the sacraments in person, kneeled
by the bedside of the dying, weeping over
their sufferings; and to provide at least for
their temporal wants, parted with all the relics
of his former splendour. He did not fall a
victim, but his strength insensibly gave way,
and when the scourge had passed by, and the
archbishop had resumed his pastoral visits, a
low fever, which undermined his worn-out
constitution, obliged him to return to Milan,
where he died, aged forty-six years. He had
chosen for sepulchre a vault near the choir in
the cathedral of Milan, and here his modern
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_169' id='Page_169'>169</a></span>
biographer observes that the numberless
miracles performed by his remains forced Pope
Paul the Fifth, in 1610, to verify his title to
canonization, and authorize the prayers long
before addressed to him by the faithful.</p>

<p class='c010' >With the life of San Carlo our host had
lent another volume from his stores, perhaps
from our curiosity concerning his native saint,
thinking us on the road to conversion, and that
it was right to light our way by a few miracles
more. The volume proved one of the renowned
“Golden Legends of Saints,” compiled by the
Dominican <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Voragine,</span> archbishop of Genoa in
the year 1298. Between asleep and awake,
I read the lives of saints Anthony and Christopher,
and found that St. Anthony, having
been tempted on the seven mortal sins, and
beaten by the demons angry at their failure,
tamed a lion about to devour his monks, and
obliged him to take service in the convent as
lay brother! that he then went to the court of
Barcelona, where a sow brought to him in her
mouth one of her litter, born without feet or
eyes, and, laying it down before the saint,
pulled him by the robe imploringly,—as much
as to say, “Pray bless it and cure it,” which
St. Anthony did, and is therefore represented
in company of a young pig, as this one for the
remainder of his life never left him.</p>

<p class='c010' >Saint Christopher had a hideous countenance,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_170' id='Page_170'>170</a></span>
and was twelve feet high. Being strong
and brave he was calculated to serve some great
prince, and resolved on selecting for master
the most powerful. He offered himself to a
mighty king, fought and conquered for him;
but Christopher had a bad habit of swearing,
and he noticed that his majesty made at every
oath the sign of the cross, and asked him why
he did so. The monarch replied, he was
afraid of the devil. “If that be the case,”
thought Christopher, “the devil must be a
more powerful master, therefore I will serve
the devil.” Having formed this determination,
he set forth to a desert, and there found
a knightly company, one of whom, most terrible
of aspect, asked him what he wanted. “I am
looking,” said Christopher, “for my lord the
devil.” “I am he,” answered the knight; and
Christopher, very joyous, became his servant.
But one day, passing before a cross, he observed
that the devil trembled, and he asked him why.
The devil confessed it was because the Saviour
was more mighty than him.</p>

<p class='c010' >Christopher, in consequence, left his service,
but this time was embarrassed as to that he
was henceforth to perform. He applied for
advice to a hermit, who desired him to fast;
but Christopher, being twelve feet high, did not
approve of the counsel, and the hermit desired
him to take up his abode on the shores of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_171' id='Page_171'>171</a></span>
very rapid river, and carry over for charity
those who had business on the other side. This
Christopher, now on the way to be a saint, performed
for some time; and one day, sleeping
in his hut, he was wakened by a child’s voice,
which said, “Christopher, come forth and bear
me over;” and going as he was called, he
found a young child on the shore, who begged
he would lift him on his shoulders. St. Christopher
took his staff and entered the river,
and the river rose by degrees more and more,
and the weight of the child increased till it
became insupportable, and yet Christopher,
though about to drown, did not let go, and by
dint of struggling arrived on the beach, and
said, “Child, that art so weighty, who art
thou?” and the child answered, “Do not marvel,
for you have carried the whole world and
him who created it.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Christopher understood that he had borne
the Lord on his shoulders, and became a great
saint. At last, desiring martyrdom, he allowed
himself to be bound and carried before a pagan
monarch, and when the latter insulted him, he
said he was bound because it was his will to
be so, and that if he chose, he could ravage
his city still. His majesty defying him to do
so, he broke his bonds, destroyed all the pagan
temples, then allowed himself to be bound
once more, and his head cut off,—predicting
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_172' id='Page_172'>172</a></span>
that his blood would be a sovereign balm for
all maladies, which it proved; for the king
and executioners were struck with blindness,
and bathing their eyes in his blood, saw
and were well again.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>September 26th.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Left <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Arona</span> for Milan, a beautiful morning.
We followed the lake, though no longer near
its edge, but the road winding through a
grove of fine chestnut-trees, and the blue water
seen through the vistas made by their
branches. Arrived at its extremity, at the
turn of the road we quitted its shore, crossing
the plain which here bounds it; with the view
of its bright expanse, (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Arona</span> with its ruin, and
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Angera</span> opposite,) now on our left, and behind
us the splendid ridge of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Monterosa</span>. We rode
along the flat till we entered a stunted oak
wood, and issuing from it, were about to leave
the Piedmontese frontier, and cross the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ticino</span>
(which at this spot issues from the lake), to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sesto
Calende</span>. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douaniers</span> came to demand the
passport, and retiring withal, spent half an
hour in its examination, during which time
we sate on our horses, looking at the lake, and
the ferry, improperly called <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pont Volant,</span> approaching
most leisurely—stared at ourselves
by a dozen women, who pressed round us,
some veiled by the elegant mantilla, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_173' id='Page_173'>173</a></span>
poorer wearing the silver or pewter ornaments,
ranged round the back of the head, which,
being hollow and of the exact shape, look like
a crown of spoons; all with the handsome
faces and most undaunted dark eyes peculiar
to their nation, and here I think also to their
sex; for the men have an expression of effeminacy
and the females of hardihood.</p>

<p class='c010' >The passport returned and the flying bridge
arrived, we led our horses on board, during
which operation Fanny in gratitude pulled me
off the plank into a foot and a half of water.
The ferry-boat, unlike the last, was a barge,
and had barriers; and during the crossing,
which occupied three quarters of an hour, a
stone-deaf man beat the flies off, and a blind
one played the violin, and sang far from badly.
They are friends, and find companionship convenient,
each supplying to the other the sense
wanting. They divided most amicably the
money we gave them, and having paid our
fare, and the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">buona mano,</span> and then something
more, under what pretext I forget, we landed
through the water again, and now in Austria’s
dominions. A soldier desired me to follow to
the commissary, while D—— remained with
the horses: so, obeying the mandate, I found
him lodged at the end of a dirty street and
top of a dark stair. He asked me fifty questions
quite irrelevant, fidgeted exceedingly, because
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_174' id='Page_174'>174</a></span>
D——’s description was not down in the passport,
and at last, Oh, Wisdom! desired me to
dictate one, which he wrote down, and being
“Middle height, grey eyes,” and otherwise as
explicit, would suit four-fifths of her majesty’s
subjects. He then made me a polite bow, said
there was nothing to pay, and we went on
again.</p>

<p class='c010' ><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sesto Calende</span> and its environs enjoy a very
indifferent reputation. I can say nothing of
the honesty of its inhabitants, but a great deal
of their incivility. Walking our horses through
the town, the boys hooted us as usual, but
arrived at the outskirts, they were joined and
augmented by youths and men, till there were
about thirty of these last following at a few
paces behind us, and shouting with the whole
force of their lungs. We bore it till it became
insupportable, and at last turned the horses,
who were excited by the noise, and fretting
at being insulted, and I think perfectly understood
they were to scatter the enemy, for they
darted on them at full speed; Fanny, in particular,
very warlike, with her small ears laid
back, and her heels thrown up to make way.
The road was clear in a second, and when our
charge was executed and we quietly walked
on, I suppose they returned to the town, as no
one followed us farther. Between <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sesto</span> and
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Somma</span> we crossed wild tracts of melancholy
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_175' id='Page_175'>175</a></span>
moor, and here and there a stunted copse.
At <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Somma</span> is the ancient and superb cypress
tree, averred to have been a sapling in Julius
Cæsar’s time, and certainly measuring twenty
feet round its stem, and a hundred and twenty
in height. For the sake of its green old age
the road diverged from the straight line by
Napoleon’s order. We passed on our right,
and within the village, a castle belonging to
the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Visconti</span> family, in which was born Teobaldo,
who was archdeacon of Liege, and
elected pope in 1271, when absent in the Holy
Land in company of Edward the First of
England, then Prince of Wales. When the
news of his promotion reached him, he ascended
the pulpit and pronounced a brilliant
discourse, taking for text the two verses of the
137th Psalm:—</p>

<p class='c010' >“If I forget thee, O Jerusalem! may my
right hand forget her cunning.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“If I do not remember thee, let my tongue
cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not
Jerusalem above my chief joy.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Arrived in Italy, Teobaldo, become Gregory
the Tenth, exerted himself to promote a
crusade, and to accomplish his end commenced
by striving to reconcile Guelphs with Ghibellines,
and to pacify Italy. It was he who first
made the law, after his death revoked, and
then again put in force, inclosing the cardinals
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_176' id='Page_176'>176</a></span>
in conclave after the decease of a pope, till
they should have elected his successor, to prevent
the papal chair from again remaining
vacant through their tardiness, as it had done
before his accession, two years and nine months.
The founder of his family’s grandeur was
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Otho Visconti</span>, born in 1208, created archbishop
of Milan by Pope Urban the Fourth,
in opposition to the La Torre, then chief of the
Republic; but after long wars and various
fortune, presented with the perpetual lordship
of the Milanese territory by the people,
weary of the cruelty and exertions of his
descendant Napoleon, and profiting by his
defeat to free themselves from the yoke of his
family, substituting in its place that of the
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Visconti</span>, whose sovereignty (with one brief
interval) was destined to flourish during nearly
two hundred years.</p>

<p class='c010' >At <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Somma</span> and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Gallerate</span>, which is the next
town on our way, have been found many
Roman antiquities, inscriptions, and medals,
and also arms: for near <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Somma</span> was fought
the first great battle between Hannibal and
Scipio, in which the latter was defeated; and
previously that of Marcellus against the
Insubrians. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Gallerate</span> takes its name, say the
antiquarians, from the legion Gallerata, encamped
there under the command of the consuls
Marcellus and Cornelius. Beyond these
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_177' id='Page_177'>177</a></span>
we were in the vine and corn country; for the
first is trained to climb the trees, oak or elm,
planted in avenues for the purpose, dropping
from one to the other in deep festoons,—a
mode of cultivation which seems wise as well
as ornamental, as it leaves a much larger portion
of ground free for other produce. The
plain is here bounded by no mountains, and
the country interesting only as the vintage
had begun; and the peasantry, proceeding to
or returning from it, reproducing at every
step the beautiful picture in the Louvre by
Robert, who died so early and unhappily:
the oxen drawing slowly along the heavy car,
with its barrel laden with grapes; the men
with red handkerchiefs tied round their black
hair, and male and female with legs bare and
bronzed by the climate, but with heads of surpassing
beauty. I particularly noticed one
girl who had the fair hair and dark eyes, so
seldom united, and the very perfection of Grecian
form: that French artists should reap
benefit in studying such features beneath such
skies is not extraordinary. We found little or
no shade, for the road was bordered only by
low hedges of acacia, now in flower, and our
horses missed the bright streams and stone
reservoirs by the road-side in Switzerland, and
impatiently sought muddy water in ditches
not yet dried since the rains. Suffering from
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_178' id='Page_178'>178</a></span>
thirst ourselves, D—— hailed some of the
vintagers, and they brought us a quantity of
grapes, to which those of France bear no comparison.
Fanny turned her head to ask and
receive her share, and in gratitude walked on
with unusual gentleness, though with the reins
on her neck, as I feared to drop any part of
my burden. We passed henceforth through a
succession of villages, boasting most savage
inhabitants, exciting the wrath of D——,
lately accustomed to the more civilized Swiss
of the German cantons. Before one <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">auberge</span>
stood a half drunken crowd, one of whom, as
we went slowly by, seized a long pole to rush
on me withal, and was with difficulty held back
by two of his comrades; the rest laughed; and
I, who had no expectation of an attack, (not
thinking a lady’s habit would wake such
animosity,) as mine enemy struggled hard, and
I did not know how the contest might end,
thought proper not to wait to see, and we rode
away. I dislike their country churches,—begun
with overweening pomp and left unfinished
when the funds have failed—their domes and
pillared façades unsuited to their situation
among trees and cabins, and far less picturesque
than those of Switzerland built on their
green or craggy mounds, with pointed windows
and spires of grey stone. We passed
crosses innumerable, many bearing, in lieu of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_179' id='Page_179'>179</a></span>
the Saviour’s figure, the sponge, nails, and
spear, carved in wood; and small cemeteries,
the recesses of the low walls which inclose
them, gaudily painted in fresco with saints
and martyrs. On a wall of a miserable inn near
Milan, the village artist has depicted a Lord’s
supper! We rode through the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cascina delle
corde;</span> or, as it is called, the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cascina del buon
Jesu!</span> a little to the right of which is seen the
town of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Busto,</span> whose church was designed by
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Bramante.</span> Of the seven old towers, formerly
the refuge of a famous robber-band, there
remains but one standing. Near <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Legnarello,</span>
on the shore of the little river <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Olona,</span> is <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Parabiago,</span>
celebrated as the site of a battle fought
in February, 1339, by <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Luchino,</span> third son of
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Maffeo Visconti</span>, against his cousin <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lodvisio</span>
and a rebel army. His horse had been killed
under him, and his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">casque</span> broken, and himself
bound to an oak tree, the blood gushing from
his wounds; till, the tide of fortune changing,
he was delivered by a party of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Savoyards,</span> and
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lodvisio</span> in his place taken captive. A wondrous
apparition startled, it was said, both
armies, and put a stop to the carnage. Saint
Ambrose, who in the fourth century was archbishop
of Milan, suddenly arose between the
rebels and allies. That he should have left his
grave to protect <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Luchino,</span> would at least prove
he interested himself in an unworthy subject:
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_180' id='Page_180'>180</a></span>
for <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Luchino’s</span> only merit seems to have been
courage. He advised and directed the murder
of his brother Marco (the bravest and
perhaps the best of this stirring family), when
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Azzo</span>, the nephew of both, as the son of their
elder brother, was lord of Milan. Marco had
distinguished himself in the service of the Ghibelline
party, and choosing that no political
consideration should interfere with its welfare,
he saw indignantly that his brother <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Galeazzo</span>
negotiated with the pope, and denounced his
proceedings to Louis of Bavaria. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Galeazzo,</span>
his son <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Azzo,</span> and his brother, were in consequence
arrested; but Marco was no sooner
aware of what his imprudence had caused, than
he repented of it, solicited their liberty of
the emperor, with an earnestness not to be
silenced; himself aided in supplying their
ransom, and, unable to furnish the entire
sum, consented to remain hostage till its completion.</p>

<p class='c010' ><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Galeazzo</span> died, and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Azzo</span> was in no haste to
deliver his uncle; but Marco, confided to a portion
of the emperor’s army, so won the hearts
of the soldiers placed to guard him, that they
named him their general. Heading them, he
surprised and took possession of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lucca,</span> sold it
to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Spinola</span> to satisfy his soldiers with its price,
and returned to Milan in July, the citizens
who had rejoiced in his triumphs—the soldiers
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_181' id='Page_181'>181</a></span>
whom he preceded in danger—the peasants
whose fields he had guarded—flocking forth to
meet him.</p>

<p class='c010' >His nephew <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Azzo,</span> and his brother <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Luchino,</span>
invited him to a festival in their castle of
Milan, and when the feasting was over and
the night far advanced, and Marco was about
to retire, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Azzo</span> requested his private hearing
of a few words, and led him to an apartment,
whose windows looked on the public square.
As the door closed on them, hired assassins
rushed on and strangled Marco, flinging his
dishonoured remains forth where the people,
impotent to avenge, might see it and shudder
as they passed at the dark end of their
warrior. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Azzo</span> died in his bed; and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Luchino</span>,
having inherited his authority, persecuted all
who had held place or power during his reign.
His severity causing a conspiracy to deprive
him of his lordship, and elevate in his stead his
nephews, sons of his brother Stefano, he discovered
the plot. The conspirators died by the
gibbet, by torture and famine; his nephews
were banished; but from that time the sombre
disposition of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Luchino</span> grew still more severe,
and his pale and menacing brow never unbent
thenceforward. He had married twice; his
second wife was <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Isabella of Fiesco,</span> a lady of
rare beauty but shameless conduct, on whose
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_182' id='Page_182'>182</a></span>
account he had exiled his nephew <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Galeazzo</span>.
Reconciled to her husband, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Isabella,</span> under
pretext of devotion, craved permission to make
a pilgrimage to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Venice.</span> A splendid flotilla
was got ready on the river Po, and the fairest
dames of Milan accompanied their liege
lady. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ugolino of Gonzagua,</span> son of the lord
of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Mantua,</span> now found favour in her eyes. He
detained her some time in his father’s states,
and accompanied her to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Venice,</span> whither she
repaired for the festival of the Ascension. On
her return to Milan the details of this journey
became whispered abroad, and the mutual
accusations of the ladies of the court at last
brought the tale to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Luchino’s</span> ear. He listened
in silence, for he meditated a fearful
revenge, and Isabella, ere she heard she was
betrayed, read his knowledge and her own
fate in his dark features; and resolving to
forestall him in crime, mixed poison in his
drink, and he died in the castle wherein he
had murdered Marco.</p>

<p class='c010' >We passed through <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Rhò</span>, a village of some
importance; beyond are rice-grounds and
extensive and unhealthy marshes. The
entrance to Milan is fine: an avenue a mile
in length of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tulipiferas,</span> now about to blossom,
with a grove on either side, conducting to
Napoleon’s memorial, the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Arco del Sempione.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_183' id='Page_183'>183</a></span>
Our passports examined, we crossed, as the sun
set, the extensive exercising ground, and the
courts of the building now serving for barracks,
once the fortified castle of the dukes of Milan,
but still retaining its ancient aspect; built of
dark brick with heavy battlements and covered
walls; that towards the town flanked by
two massive round towers, on which cannon
are now pointed, ready at need to awe the
town.</p>

<p class='c010' >We summoned an idler to be our guide, and
without him should have failed in arriving ere
midnight, for Milan boasts an incomprehensible
collection of crooked streets, and an
insolent population, who would have lent no
aid in the labyrinth. Young and old crowded
about us, almost preventing our horses from
moving forward, and hooted manfully. Yet
I am told the governor’s daughter and officer’s
wives ride constantly in the Corso, but not
daring to offer insult to the Austrian masters,
who I heard with satisfaction make no difficulty
of correcting with the blow of a cane or
the flat of the sword, a word from a refractory
vassal, they compensate for the privation
when an opportunity offers, as now. We rode
by the beautiful cathedral, and through more
winding alleys, some so narrow that two carriages
cannot pass, made dangerous for horses
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_184' id='Page_184'>184</a></span>
by the bands of flat pavement laid down to
facilitate the roll of the wheels, and arrived at
dusk at San Marco. I do not think it a good
inn: its rooms are large, but dirty; its servants
numerous, but inattentive; and its
cookery greasy beyond description.</p>

“Yes, you had better ask his charge beforehand,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_186' id='Page_186'>186</a></span>
as he may be extravagant; and there
are about a dozen steps to descend, and should
his demand be exorbitant, you can give him
two-thirds or the half, which will satisfy him.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Passing the post-office and finding no letters,
we arrived at the cathedral in five minutes. It
occupies one extremity of a most irregular
place, and if its façade wants taste, or at least
consistency, having some doors and windows of
Roman architecture, mingled with the Gothic,
and its form is that of a heavy pyramid,—yet
seen in the bright sunshine, its mass of white
marble, with all its pinnacles surmounted by
statues, standing shining forth from the purest
of blue skies as if they were carved in snow,
its effect is far more striking than the engravings
would lead to expect, and the grandeur
of its size and delicacy of its execution justify
the exclamation of Joseph the Second: “It is
a golden mountain, chiselled by fairies, and
metamorphosed to marble.” The statues
which adorn the edifice are in number about
four thousand five hundred, of which two hundred
and fifty decorate the façade. Each of
the twelve needles supports a colossal figure;
that of the Virgin having for base the tallest
of all, of Moorish architecture. Her statue is in
gilt copper, and from the pavement to the
glory round her head the elevation is a hundred
and eight metres, eighty-six centimetres.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_187' id='Page_187'>187</a></span>
To describe these and the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">bassi relievi</span> which
encrust the façade of this noble church would
be endless, and indeed the intense heat prevented
my examining the half of them; but I
particularly remarked for their beauty the two
figures which represent the Old and New Testament
at either end of the great balcony
above the chief portal. The two interior
columns of this central entrance, for there are
five, are of enormous height and size, considering
that each is carved of a single block of the
pink granite of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Baveno</span>. Within, the cathedral
is divided into five aisles (the nave being of
double width), separated by fifty-two massive
pillars of octagon form; four others of far
heavier dimensions, raised in the centre of the
church, support the cupola, and their strange
capitals each exhibit eight statues. On the
right near the entrance is the tomb of Eribert,
archibishop of Milan, who died in 1035, and
farther against the wall a monument, which is a
Gothic gem, decorated with small statues, each
in its niche; while on the top lies in marble
effigy one <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Marco Carelli,</span> who gave 35,000
golden ducats towards the expenses of the
building. Of the chapels, that best worthy
notice is beside the small door which opens on
the stair, whose 512 steps conduct to the dome
erected to the memory of Giovanni and
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Gabriello de’ Medici,</span> by
Pope <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pius</span> the Fourth
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_188' id='Page_188'>188</a></span>
their brother. The real name was <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Medechino</span>
though <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giovanni,</span> become one of the great
captains of his day, took advantage of its
similitude with that of the Florentine house,
and adopted their armorial bearings. He had
obtained distinction early. Presented when a
young officer to Francis Sforza, who having
married Blanche of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Visconti</span>, and lost his
father-in-law, after their long dissensions,
became, in the latter’s place, lord of Milan;
he gained his entire confidence. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Astorio Visconti</span>
might, it was feared, assert his right to
the Milanese sovereignty, and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Medechino,</span> with
another named <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pozzino,</span> were chosen for his
assassins. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Astorio</span> dead, Sforza’s anxiety to
rid himself of his accomplices, induced him to
command the death of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pozzino,</span> while <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giovanni
Giacomo</span> received an order to repair to
the castle of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Muzzo,</span> on the shores of the
lake of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Como,</span> charged with a letter for the
governor. On his way thither, though they
had parted on the best terms, he suspected
the intentions of Sforza, and opened his despatches.
Finding there his doubts confirmed,
he fabricated others, commanding the governor
to yield him present possession of the fortress,
and once installed therein, he held it against
all the efforts of the duke of Milan. He afterwards
took <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Chiavenna;</span> and, lastly, offered
himself to Charles the Fifth, the emperor, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_189' id='Page_189'>189</a></span>
created him duke of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Marignano,</span> and to whom
his courage and conduct rendered signal service
in the wars of Germany. Having incurred
the emperor’s displeasure, by unnecessarily
prolonging the siege of Sienna, at the
head of the army which Charles placed at the
disposal of the Grand Duke Cosmo to subdue
the revolted inhabitants, and also by his pillage
and cruelties exercised towards the peasantry
of the country which surrounds the
town during the eight months the siege lasted,
he fell ill from grief at losing his master’s
favour, and died at Milan,—where, four years
after, his brother, elected pope, raised this
mausoleum to his memory, designed by Michael
Angelo. The six beautiful columns are in
Roman marble, the remainder of marble of
Carrara, excepting the statues which are of
bronze; those of the brothers, of colossal size,
occupying the centre, between two weeping
figures of Peace and Heroism.</p>

<p class='c010' >The large chapel, dedicated to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Giovanni
Buono,</span> which terminates the transept, is
next in order: it contains some fine <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">bassi
relievi</span> and statues; among the latter a group,
near the altar, of a guardian angel, who carefully
leads a child, while his foot holds down,
without an effort, a prostrate demon. At the entrance
of this chapel stand two colossal figures
of saints, bad, and in plaster,—though not
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_190' id='Page_190'>190</a></span>
perhaps injurious to the effect of the whole, and
to judge of it, this spot is the best which
can be chosen. We gazed at all its details,
the hollow of the high dome rich with countless
statues; the chapel opposite, with its rich
stained window, seen athwart a forest of
columns; the light through the coloured glass
crossing with a red ray pillar and floor, and
touching the forms of bishop and cardinal in
their niches; on the capitals the square grated
aperture, before the steps of the choir, which
gives light and air to the burial place of St.
Charles; the semi-circular pulpits of carved
and gilded bronze, supported by bronze
figures, leaned each against its massive
column; the sculptured stalls of the canons,—the
altar with its curious temple and red
canopy, and the tall painted windows seen
behind it, and the golden star shining on the
roof above, within which lies the relic of the
St. Cloud which, with multifarious ceremonies,
is once a year let down by pulleys to meet
the eyes of the faithful, and with like pomp
mounted to its place again:—the rich lamps
suspended by gilded chains, and the priests
officiating in their robes of black, green, and
crimson,—and the view seen dimly through
and along the pillared arches where they turn
round choir and high altar. The white
marble has no glare; it is stained with a succession
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_191' id='Page_191'>191</a></span>
of softer greys than mellow stone. Near
the same chapel of San Giovanni, and the entrance
to the subterranean passage which,
imagined by <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pellegrini,</span> leads
to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archevêché,</span>
hangs, suspended from a pillar, a much-prized
picture by <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Procaccini,</span> effaced almost
wholly.</p>

<p class='c010' >As we passed on beside the choir, we looked
through the gratings which, surmounted by
most delicate sculpture, light the subterranean
chapel beneath, also having marble columns,
balustrades, and altars. Opposite is a fine monument
in black, supporting a figure in white
marble, which reclines upon it,—the head resting
on the hand, executed by <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Augustin Busti,</span>
to the memory of the Cardinal <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Marini Caracciolo;</span>
and near it and the door, which opens
into the southern sacristy, and which I beg you
to notice for its lovely and elaborate carvings,
hangs an effigy of Our Lady of Succour. Italian
taste has glazed this picture, which is an
ancient one, and represents the Virgin giving
the breast to the Saviour, who stands on her
knee,—and stuck, outside the glass, above the
heads and across the throats, tin crowns and
bead necklaces. Above, its pedestal jutting
from the wall, is the statue of Pope Martin
the Fifth, raised by the command of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Filippo
Mario Visconti</span>, last duke of Milan of the name.
The flayed St. Bartholomew, who carries his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_192' id='Page_192'>192</a></span>
skin on his shoulders, is a fine specimen of
anatomy, and a most disagreeable production
of art. Past the three stained windows and the
long lists of relics contained in the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Duomo</span>, is a
strange tomb, which resembles a red marble
chest, supported aloft by two columns, and containing
the ashes of Otho, archbishop of Milan.
The seated statue above is that of Pope <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pius</span>
the Fourth; next comes the door of the
northern sacristy, even more beauteous in its
sculpture than its companion, and the tomb
of the three brothers, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Arcimboldi.</span> We had
arrived at the first chapel in the transept,
dedicated to St. Thecla, who is there among
the lions, all carved in white marble,—a red
riband and silver heart hung round her neck
by some devotee.</p>

<p class='c010' >The large chapel, which corresponding to
that of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Giovanni Buono,</span> terminates this
cross aisle, is dedicated to the Virgin; and
beautiful, in spite of masses of artificial flowers
in the hands and tinsel on the heads, is the
group of the Virgin and Child. On either side
of the entrance is a colossal plaster statue,
even worse executed than those in <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Giovanni’s</span>
chapel, and the floor in front is paved
with the tombs of six cardinals. Farther on,
descending the aisle, there is over an altar a
wooden crucifix inclosed in a glass frame,
interesting because the same which was carried
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_193' id='Page_193'>193</a></span>
by St. Charles Borromeo when he walked
barefoot in the processions he instituted
during the plague of 1576. There existed
here formerly an antique altar, remarkable
for its age only, surmounted by a figure of the
Virgin in wood, rudely carved and heavily
framed. When removed some time since,
there were discovered behind it two inscriptions
by one Alexio of Albania, an officer of
Duke Francis Sforza, who, in gratitude to
Our Lady for his successes, raised this altar in
the year 1480. Near the entrance stands the
baptismal font, (a large vase of porphyry,
brought, it is believed, from the baths of
Maximilian,) beneath a tabernacle, whose
pillars are of antique marble, and their capitals
of carved bronze.</p>

<p class='c010' >The pavement, with its arabesque ornaments
and various coloured marbles, is worn
by the feet of curious or faithful, and from
the dirty habits of the numbers who frequent
the church, forces one to tread it with the
same precaution as the streets themselves.</p>

<p class='c010' >Having made the tour, we returned to rest
ourselves on one of the benches opposite the
choir, allowable, where people walk and talk
unscrupulously during mass, for I noticed
even priests doing so with the unconcern of
two boys, who kneeled before <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Giovanni
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_194' id='Page_194'>194</a></span>
Buono,</span> praying a little and talking a little by
turns. Opposite the doors of the two sacristies
are steps conducting to the subterranean
chapels, the roof of the first supported by
eight massive marble columns. The sunbeams
from above entered faintly, touching
with their gold a part of the quaint carving,
and leaving the rest in obscurity, hardly
lessened by the light which burned feebly in
the elegantly formed lamp before the marble
balustrade of the altar. The guide leads the
way to the inner chapel, which is St. Charles’s
sepulchre. From the grated opening in the
floor above, it receives but a pale and imperfect
day; and as the torch which the
priest bears flashes on the riches it contains,
its precious metals and marble floor, to the
worth of four millions, it resembles Aladdin’s
cave rather than a burial place. The vault
is of octagon form, the roof encrusted with
silver <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">bassi relievi,</span> recalling the principal
events of the saint’s life; the panels of cloth
of gold divided by silver Caryatides, representing
the Virtues, one at each angle; and
the saint’s embalmed body attired in pontifical
robes laid at its extremity in a shrine of rock
crystal mounted in silver and ornamented with
the arms of Philip the Fourth of Spain, (by
whom it was presented to the cathedral,)
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_195' id='Page_195'>195</a></span>
wrought in massive gold; the dead face and
hands are bare, the latter covered with jewels,
which sparkle as in mockery.</p>

<p class='c010' >Having spent the day in the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Duomo</span>, the
curiosity next in order was La Scala. You
know that it retains this name because erected
on the site of a church founded by Beatrice of
La Scala, wife of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Bernabo Visconti</span>. We went
thither in the evening, the opera being <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Roberto
Devereux,</span> and the ballet the last <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Visconti</span>
and first Sforza. The house, which
yields in size only to San Carlo of Naples, is
freshly and brilliantly decorated; its six rows
of boxes which each with its drapery are
carried up the whole height, its pit seventy-five
feet long and sixty-six broad, are capable of
containing three thousand six hundred spectators.
Its demerits are, that its fine lustre
lights its immense space imperfectly; that the
effect of the royal box which fronts the stage
and is handsome, is injured by the crown
above it, out of all proportion ponderous;
that its singers are scarce above mediocrity,
and its scenery below criticism. Whether
from these causes or the season, there were
not a dozen people in the boxes, and the
parterre was but half filled. The governor’s
box is within two of the stage, but he did not
occupy it. La Scala once boasted a first-rate
scene-painter, but dying, he failed to drop
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_196' id='Page_196'>196</a></span>
his mantle on his successor, and, saving a few
of his faded scenes, you can fancy nothing so
pitiable. The <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">prima donna,</span> who performs
Queen Elizabeth of England and possesses a
voice just passable, is unhappily plain, and
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Roberto Devereux,</span> Earl of Essex, chanted a
base most awful. The costumes were of any
and no period, and yet the audience in the
pit determined to be pleased, and compensating
for its small numbers by applauding
manfully, demanded the performers at the close
of the first act, when Roberto and his beloved,
who, fearing the queen’s ire, had just parted
for ever, came forward to bow and curtsey
hand in hand. Of the undelivered ring we
heard nothing, but a great deal of a dirty
blue scarf which belonged to the damsel, and
by mistake was sent as a token to the queen.
Quitting the opera at the end of the second act,
an Italian custom which would destroy all illusion,
if such existed, we summoned patience to
see the ballet, more fatiguing to the eyes and
incomprehensible to the understanding than
anything I could have imagined, the heads,
arms and hands of the actors moving in unison
with every note of the music, and forming a
ludicrous contrast to the expressive French
pantomime and magical decorations of the
grand Opera. The dancers were ungraceful,
but all, even to the fat <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">figurantes,</span> were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_197' id='Page_197'>197</a></span>
applauded noisily, and they have, I observe, the
habit of concluding each pas seul with a
grateful curtsey to the pit. The palace of
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Visconti</span> was a chaos of tin, coloured paper
and sheets of foil, and the ballet ended with a
seafight, (rockets sent across the stage representing
cannon,) and the entrance of a party
of pasteboard deities who came in on wheels.
We did not wait for the last act of the opera,
preferring to stroll home by the light of a
young moon.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>28th.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Torrents of rain. We passed a part of the
day at the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Brera,</span> which was, in times of yore,
the monastery of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Umiliati</span>; the order
which produced St. Charles’s assassin, and on
its suppression was yielded to that of the
Jesuits, who have left in its noble courts and
spacious halls the mark of their wealth and
power. A double tier of pillared arcades
surrounds the court, while opposite the entrance
is the fine staircase, designed by the
architect <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Piermarini;</span> a monument to whose
memory, with others sacred to native poets
and painters, occupy places beneath these
porticoes, for the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Brera</span> unites within its walls
the picture gallery, the cabinet of medals, the
observatory, and the schools of painting,
sculpture, architecture and anatomy, besides
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_198' id='Page_198'>198</a></span>
a gymnasium and a botanical garden on the
spot where the monks cultivated theirs. In
the fine rooms which contain the paintings
are some of the most splendid I have seen of
Paul Veronese, particularly the Adoration of
the Saviour by the Wise Men of the East,
whose subject might puzzle a novice, for the
wise men are dressed in the costume of Paul’s
time, one of them accompanied by his dwarf,
and the baby Christ wears a pearl diadem on
his brow. I noticed also a superb Vandyck,
St. Ambrose in Prayer to the Virgin, and a
Last Supper by Rubens, whose composition it
would be difficult not to prefer to that on the
same subject by Paul Veronese. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Guercino’s</span>
Abraham and Agar, which several students
were employed in copying badly, is very
beautiful; the weeping face of Agar about to
go forth to the desert contrasts finely with
the proud and half averted one of Sara. In
one of the rooms are several heads of the
famed fresco of Leonardo da Vinci, carefully
raised from the walls of what was the refectory
of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Santa Maria delle Grazie,</span> and is now a
barrack-room. We had gone thither hoping
to see its remains, but the convent, converted
to military uses, is not now shown. We could
enter the church only, which, an ill-formed
mass of red brick without, is curious within,
and has a side chapel filled with monuments,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_199' id='Page_199'>199</a></span>
decorated with ultra Catholic care, but many
of them ancient and interesting. The head of
the Saviour, which is at the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Brera,</span> is mild and
beautiful in expression, but its colouring
wholly faded.</p>

<p class='c010' >The library is rich in curious manuscripts,
and occupies five spacious apartments; in the
first are two bad portraits of the emperor and
his consort. All the modern productions we
saw, for there is a smaller chamber dedicated
to them, were strangely wretched in their execution.</p>

<p class='c010' >This part of Milan contains the widest
streets and finest <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">palazzi;</span> the latter awoke my
admiration, with their double gates and
arcaded courts, surrounded by orange and
pomegranate trees.</p>

<p class='c010' >The most interesting spot in Milan, recalling
as it does names famous in its story, is
the old castle, which held in turn the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Visconti</span>
and the Sforza. Originally built in 1358 by
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Galeazzo</span>, lord of Milan, it was demolished at
his death through the jealous fears of the
citizens, but rebuilt by his son <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giovanni
Galeazzo</span>. It stood unmolested till the decease
of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Filippo Mario,</span> last duke of the
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Visconti</span> family, when the Milanese, determined
on adopting a republican form of
government, razed it to the ground once more.
Francis Sforza, married to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Blanche,</span> daughter
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_200' id='Page_200'>200</a></span>
of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Filippo Mario,</span> and become duke of Milan,
raised it from its ruins with strength and
extent greater than before. It is this, of the
date of 1450, which exists even now, for only
its fortifications were destroyed in 1801 by
Napoleon’s order, substituting a vast open
space and avenues, which form shady promenades.
Towards the town are the two
massive round towers, and entering on this
side you cross five inner courts, in the last of
which (that fronting the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">place d’armes</span> and
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Arco del Sempione</span>) are the ancient state
apartments. On the capitals of the columns
which support the vestibule of the grand staircase
are carved the arms of Sforza and
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Visconti</span>; the latter bare the serpent on their
escutcheon on account of the exploit of an
ancestor who, ere yet his family ruled Milan,
marched to the first crusade with Godfrey of
Bouillon, and there, in single combat, killed a
Saracen general, and despoiled him of his
arms and the shield on which was emblazoned
a snake swallowing a child.</p>

<p class='c010' ><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giovanni Galeazzo Visconti</span>, born in 1347,
whose daughter Valentine espoused the duke
of Orleans, the murdered son of Charles the
Fifth of France, purchased of the Emperor
Wenceslas the rank of duke, which he bore
first of his family. He was a believer in
astrology, and when already attacked with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_201' id='Page_201'>201</a></span>
plague, a comet becoming visible in the
heavens, he made no doubt that it appeared
to summon him.</p>

<p class='c010' >His son Giovanni Mario commenced his reign
by a parricide. The duchess, his mother, favoured
the Guelph party. That of the Ghibellines,
under the name and by the authority of the
duke, then fifteen years of age, forced her to
fly to Monza. Surprising her there, they dragged
her back to the castle of Milan, and soon after
murdered her within its walls. Giovanni
Mario, by turns the instrument of Guelph and
Ghibelline, lost his large possessions one by
one, till only the town of Milan obeyed his
sway, and even within the ducal city the sole
prerogative he reserved to himself was the
command of its executions.</p>

<p class='c010' >From his childhood surrounded by crime,
and inured to the sight of blood, he at last
found pleasure only in witnessing a fellow
creature’s agony as the sole excitement strong
enough to rouse him. The slow forms of
justice slurred over or put aside, the condemned
were delivered to his power to be
hunted to death by bull-dogs, whom his huntsman
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Gevanco</span> had taught the taste of human
flesh to accustom them to their fearful office.
At last, when the measure of his crimes was
overflowing, he was massacred by the Milanese
nobles as he was about to enter the church of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_202' id='Page_202'>202</a></span>
St. Gothard, the 16th of May, 1412, aged
only twenty-two years. His brother <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Filippo
Mario,</span> on the news of his death, obliged the
widow of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Facino Cave, Giovanni’s</span> trusted
general, who had died of malady the same day
as the duke by violence, to marry him ere she
had laid her husband in his grave, and
although she was twenty years his senior; she
held at her disposal a brilliant army, the
garrisons of various towns, and a fortune of
four hundred thousand golden florins.</p>

<p class='c010' >Taking instant possession of her riches, he
purchased with their distribution the fidelity
of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Facino’s</span> soldiers, and marched to Milan, of
which they made him master. He undertook
to reduce Lombardy to the obedience she had
sworn to his father, but being cruel and crafty,
and not brave, and seldom daring to leave the
shelter of his fortified walls, he seemed little
fitted to accomplish such an enterprise. It
happened, however, on almost the only occasion
in which <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Filippo Mario</span> had been present
in battle, that he distinguished among his
soldiers one named <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Carmagnuola</span>, who, born
in the lowest grade of society, had been an
officer’s servant, and now first enrolled himself
in the ranks of the army. Apt to discern
the military merit he could not imitate,
he made <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Carmagnuola</span> his officer, and the
latter, rewarding his quicksightedness, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_203' id='Page_203'>203</a></span>
himself recompensed with the titles of count
and the rank of general, reconquered all Lombardy.
But <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Filippo Mario,</span> in the caprice of
tyranny, flung down the foundations of his
fortune. Falsely accusing his wife Beatrice
of being untrue to him, he sent her to perish
on the scaffold; and suddenly taking umbrage
at the power and distinction of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Carmagnuola</span>,
he dismissed him from the command of his
troops, denied him an interview, flung into
prison his wife and daughters, and forced his
general to fly for safety to Venice, whither he
was followed by an assassin, who failed to
accomplish his errand.</p>

<p class='c010' >Treachery obliging <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Carmagnuola</span> to treason
against the state he had first served, he
took the command of the armies of the two
republics of Venice and Florence, and the duke
of Milan found him a victorious enemy, though
opposed to his son-in-law Francis Sforza.
After a signal defeat of the Milanese the peace
which ensued restored his wife and children to
liberty, but <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Carmagnuola</span> had roused Venetian
suspicion by generously sending back all the
prisoners he had made in battle, and when on
the renewal of the war he met with unusual
reverses, they called his ill fortune perfidy.
The Council of Ten, in consequence, summoned
him to Venice, there to advise the republic
daring the negotiations for peace, received
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_204' id='Page_204'>204</a></span>
him with extraordinary pomp, the doge
honouring him with a seat by his side, and
expressing to him affection and gratitude as
the voice of the republic; but hardly had his
soldiers retired, leaving him unguarded in the
senate, than <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Carmagnuola</span>, destined to be the
mark of ingratitude, was seized and heavily
ironed, flung into a dungeon, and given to
the torture. Twenty days after his arrest he
was brought forth—gagged lest he should
assert his innocence,—and beheaded. Of all
his immense wealth which it confiscated, the
republic only allowing a poor annuity to his
daughters.</p>

<p class='c010' >His death, in 1432, delivered Duke <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Filippo
Mario</span> from his most formidable foe, but ever
pursuing the same wavering policy during his
whole reign, he troubled and devastated Italy
with an inconstancy of motive and action not
to be comprehended. His natural daughter
Blanche long promised and at last married to
Francis Sforza, he by turns united his generals
against his son-in-law, or sought his protection
against them. He had once again had
recourse to him, and peace between them was
hardly ratified, when, as Francis and Blanche
were on their way to join him at Milan, he
was seized with fever, and died almost suddenly.</p>

<p class='c010' >This Francis Sforza, who succeeded to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_205' id='Page_205'>205</a></span>
last <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Visconti</span>, despite the right of the duke of
Orleans, whose mother was Valentine of Milan,
was the son of a brave man, himself the founder
of his family. His name was <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giaco Attendolo,</span>
and his father a labourer; and the young man,
though, from feelings of duty to his family, he
pursued the like toil, was often distracted from
his occupation by a feeling which might be a
presentiment of future fortunes, that his place
of exertion was elsewhere. One day, while
employed in cutting copsewood, he heard the
sound of military music proceeding from a
troop of soldiers advancing along the high
road which bounded his father’s field, and his
old longings and hesitation returned upon him.
With something of the superstition of his time,
he resolved that a presage should decide on
his destiny, and turning his face towards an
oak tree, which grew at no inconsiderable
distance, and towered among the bushes old
and mighty, he flung his hatchet against its
trunk: “If it falls harmless,” he said, “my
arm shall be that of a peasant still; if it
pierces to the core, I am a soldier!” Hurled
with his whole force, the axe cut through the
bark, and sank deep into the tree, and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Attendolo,</span>
casting one glance where it lay buried
in the stem of the old oak, sprang from the
place where he stood, and among the ranks of
the soldiers: “My strength has decided my
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_206' id='Page_206'>206</a></span>
fate,” he exclaimed, “you may call me
Sforza.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Received as one of their band, his impetuosity
and courage, which suffered no
counsel, and was stopped by no resistance,
soon confirmed a name which became that of
his family. It was an epoch for military
talent, and Sforza in a short time was of the
chief of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">condottieri</span> who sold their service
to those states whose gold was most plenty,
and commanded a thousand horsemen.</p>

<p class='c010' >In the year 1414, he conducted his army to
Naples, and obtained honours and employment
from Jane the Second, queen of Naples, but
when James of Bourbon, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comte de la Marche,</span>
her husband, less patient than she had expected,
seized on her low-born lover <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Alopo,</span>
and condemned him to die in torments, Sforza
was flung into a dungeon, where he remained
a year, during which period the queen was
captive also, and watched unceasingly by an
old French knight, who was her gaoler.</p>

<p class='c010' >A popular disturbance, occasioned by Neapolitan
indignation, at length freed the sovereign.
James, whose day of power was over,
as he supported impatiently the influence of
the queen’s new favourite <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Caraccioli,</span> was
arrested in turn, and though at the pope’s
intercession he recovered his liberty, he thought
fit to make his escape from the palace, and fly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_207' id='Page_207'>207</a></span>
to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tarento,</span> with the intent of stirring to insurrection
the southern provinces. Besieged
there, and losing all hopes of reigning at
Naples, he returned to France and exchanged
his kingly robes for the habit of St. Francis in
the convent of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ste. Claire of Besançon,</span> where
he died.</p>

<p class='c010' >Towns, fortresses, and fiefs of importance,
rewarded Sforza’s fidelity; his soldiers were
more devoted to him than ever before adventurers
had been to a <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">condottiere.</span> He had
summoned his relatives around him, men, like
himself, reared in fatigues and hardships, and
who made a ring of gallant and devoted
followers about his person. His rival in the
same career, one whose glory and genius
equalled his own, was the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">condottiere Forte
Braccio</span>, and in almost every occasion in which
their forces took different sides, Sforza’s had
the disadvantage. When, after having long
served Queen Jane, he was won over by Pope
Martin the Fifth to quit her defence for that
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Louis of Anjou,</span> opposed
to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Braccio</span> he lost
almost the whole of his army. Throwing himself
on his generosity, he rode to the camp
with fifteen unarmed horsemen, and asked his
interest with Queen Jane, whose soldier he
was determined to be once more. Forgetting
their long rivalry, the two captains repaired
to her court, where Jane received Sforza and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_208' id='Page_208'>208</a></span>
named him lord high constable. Soon after,
she commanded him to oppose his forces to
those of her adopted son, Alfonso of Arragon,
to whose party <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Braccio</span> had remained attached.
Thus, though unwillingly, they became foes
again; and Sforza, having forced Alfonso to
abandon Naples, marched to deliver the town
of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Aquila,</span> besieged
by <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Braccio.</span> The 4th of
January, 1424, he arrived on the shores of the
river <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pescara. Braccio’s</span> troops, which occupied
the town of the same name, had defended
its banks with palisades.</p>

<p class='c010' >Determined to ford it, though at the very
mouth, armed, and wearing his helmet, Sforza
first spurred his horse into the water, traversed
it at the head of four hundred men at arms,
and dislodged the enemy; but the remainder
of his forces having failed to follow, he swam
his charger back to seek them.</p>

<p class='c010' >Crossing for the third time, on his return to
the attack, when about half way over, he saw
one of his young pages, whom the strength of
the current was about to bear away, and stooping
suddenly over his horse to seize and save
him, himself lost his balance, and sank; the
weight of his armour preventing him from
swimming, and even rendering it impossible
to recover his drowned body. He was the
ablest and most intrepid of Italian warriors.
Of his posterity all lived and died obscurely,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_209' id='Page_209'>209</a></span>
saving the illegitimate son, who was duke of
Milan, Francis Sforza.</p>

<p class='c010' >We have lingered perhaps too long for
your patience in the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Castello;</span> and the Arena,
which, entering Milan by the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Arco del Sempione,</span>
or Della Pace, as it is now called, is on
the left hand, is worth a visit. We walked
there last evening: the principal entrance also
gives access to the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pulvinare,</span> a fine building,
which contains a spacious hall and commodious
chambers, arranged for the reception of
the court on the occasion of a gala. A broad
stair conducts to the former, whose columns of
red granite face the amphitheatre to which
descend its granite steps, the place assigned
to the viceroy and dignitaries of Milan, and
covered with cushions and draperies when so
honoured. The seats which surround this
amphitheatre, capable of containing thirty
thousand persons, are covered with green turf,
and rise, range above range, up the sloping
sides to the level, which forms a pleasant walk
under orange and taller trees. There is a
rivulet which fills the space with water, when,
instead of the races usually held here, the
exhibition is to be nautical. A grand fête
will take place in a few days with a show of
fireworks, our host says unparalleled! but the
rain, which to-day has fallen in torrents, seems
disinclined to give place to them, and will
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_210' id='Page_210'>210</a></span>
prepare unpleasantly the green sofas of the
audience. Notwithstanding the weather, we
visited the sixteen Corinthian columns, which
in this ancient city are the sole vestige of
Roman grandeur; thirty-three Paris inches in
diameter, they are ten diameters in height,
and are believed to have stood in the exterior
vestibule of baths dedicated to Hercules, and
restored by the Emperor Maximilian. From
their proximity to the church of San Lorenzo,
they are called by its name; they stand majestic
and isolated, and spite the care bestowed
on their preservation, gradually crumbling to
decay. The rain continues as I have seldom
seen it fall elsewhere, and as it falls here sometimes
for a fortnight uninterruptedly, so says
our host in consolation; I did not expect to
dine at Milan, and at two in the afternoon, by
candlelight; yet this has happened to us
twice, (when we chose that hour, hoping the
fog would yield to a fine evening, which it
did not,) in the large room, with its three high
windows looking on the opposite wall, which
resembles the deserted refectory of a convent.
To-morrow, 1st of October, we hope to leave
on our way to Lodi.</p>

<div class='c008'><span class='small'>1st October.</span></div>
<p class='c009' >Having watched torrents falling till eleven
they subsided to a mild rain, under which we
started in weariness of San Marco; and about
three leagues from Milan, passed the village
of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Bicocca</span>, in whose château <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Prospero
Colonna</span> had taken up his position when
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_212' id='Page_212'>212</a></span>
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lautrec</span>, the French general, was obliged by
his Swiss troops to give battle. Francis the
First, who had lately lost Milan, had been
obliged to negotiate with each canton separately,—to
distribute bribes and promise pensions,
and, to obtain their aid, to bear with
their arrogance. Ten thousand Swiss passed,
in consequence, the Mount St. Bernard in the
year 1522, and with the French and Venetian
troops encamped at about two miles from
Milan. The city was ably defended, though
Francis Sforza had yet been unable to re-enter
his capital,—and by his chancellor’s order, an
eloquent monk, to arouse the zeal of the
Milanese, preached against the barbarians.
The Milan army swelled its ranks with German
mercenaries; that of France obtained an unexpected
reinforcement in the person of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giovanni
de’ Medici,</span> who, rendered free by the death of
Leo the Tenth, arrived to profit by the higher
pay and greater advantages the service of
France offered him, conducting three thousand
foot and two hundred horse beneath the mourning
banners, adopted in memory of the deceased
Pope, giving them the name of Black Bands,
which their prowess made so celebrated.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lautrec</span> had attacked and been obliged to
raise the siege of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pavia</span>. The Swiss troops, in
the belief that money, destined for their pay,
was arrived at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Arona</span>, implored their general
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_213' id='Page_213'>213</a></span>
to allow them to force a passage thither; but
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lautrec</span>, aware that the distress of the imperial
army surpassed his own, and having
already received entire companies of deserters
from the banner of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Prospero Colonna,</span> felt that
delays would best dissipate his army; but the
Swiss replied, through Albert de Stein: “To-morrow
pay, or battle; or, after to-morrow,
dismissal: choose between.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Forced to allow their departure, wanting
funds to satisfy them, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lautrec</span> chose first to give
battle. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Bicocca</span> was surrounded by deep
ditches, to the right and left were canals, and
behind it a stone bridge. Defended by
artillery and the Spanish harquebuss men,
the position was almost impregnable; yet the
eight thousand Swiss insisted on attacking it
in front, while the Marshal of Foix turned the
left flank, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lautrec</span> the right of the Imperial
army. The Swiss, notwithstanding their
bravery, forced back with great carnage,
though protected in their attack by Giovanni
de’ Medici and his black bands, made their
retreat in good order. There were yet no
uniforms worn, and the troops were distinguished
by the red cross of the Imperials, and
the white cross of France; and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lautrec</span>, to
penetrate more easily into <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Colonna’s</span> camp,
obliged his soldiers to change, for the Italian,
their national colour. The Marshal of Foix,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_214' id='Page_214'>214</a></span>
arrived at the bridge, defeated the Milanese
of Francis Sforza, and, supported, might have
gained the battle; but the impatient Swiss
retreated in discomfiture ere yet he had time
to arrive, and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Prospero Colonna,</span> informed of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lautrec’s</span> stratagem, easily recognised the
spurious red crosses from those of his own
soldiers, who wore, by his order, each a green
branch as plume to his helmet. The Swiss
infantry, still unpaid, and having lost in this
unfortunate affair three thousand men, retired
across the frontier. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lautrec</span>, anxious to
justify himself in the eyes of Francis the First,
to tell him, with his own mouth, that to hold
the Milanese territory with men-at-arms left
eighteen months without pay, and unsatisfied
and mutinous Swiss, was impossible, yielded
the command, for a time, to the Marshal of
Foix, his brother, and hastened to the royal
presence, accompanied by two domestics only.
The king refused him an audience; but protected
by the constable of Bourbon, he
obtained one ere long, and to the demand of
Francis—“How can you justify my losses and
your conduct?” he made the simple reply:
“Sire, by the lack of sums to pay your
armies.” It became evident, that of the three
hundred thousand crowns promised by the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Surintendant des Finances, Samblançay</span>, none
had reached him.</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_215' id='Page_215'>215</a></span>
The king, surprised, summoned his minister,
who acknowledged that the sums, which were
in truth destined for the troops in Italy, had
been demanded by, and remitted to the king’s
mother, Louisa, duchess of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Angoulême.</span> In his
anger Francis reproached the duchess bitterly
with the loss of Milan, but the princess replied,
that the monies received from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Samblançay</span>
were but a debt he owed her, as she had
placed in his hands funds proceeding from her
revenues, and the fruit of her economy. The
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Surintendant’s</span> assurances to the contrary, his
known character for probity, and his habits of
life, which kept him apart from all court
intrigues or passions, convinced the king, who
was so attached to him as to have contracted
the habit of calling him “Father.” He distinguished
the innocent from the guilty; he
said, “While we betray ourselves, Fortune
favours us in vain.” <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Samblançay</span> remained in
place, but his fall was decided on by his
enemy, the Chancellor <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Duprat,</span> and the
Duchess Louisa of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Angoulême,</span> whom either
avarice or her known hatred to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lautrec</span>, or
these feelings united, had moved to such base
conduct.</p>

<p class='c010' >In 1525, when Francis was about to quit
France to reconquer his duchy of Milan, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Samblançay</span>
was required and dared refuse to
advance the sums needful, alleging that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_216' id='Page_216'>216</a></span>
three hundred thousand crowns were already
due to him. He gave in his accounts, proved
the truth of his assertions, and lost place and
favour. Francis departed; Louisa of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Angoulême,</span>
once more regent of the kingdom, made
use of her power to crush <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Samblançay</span>. It was
said that her receipt, signed by her hand, was
abstracted by her agent from among his
papers, while one of his own clerks was brought
forward to accuse, of fraud and peculation, the
most honest man of his time. The king, who
in the interval had, in February, 1525, lost
the battle of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pavia</span>, and, conducted prisoner to
Spain, been detained there prisoner till January,
1526, at the close of the latter year, with
sorrow consented to his minister’s seclusion in
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bastille.</span> His vindictive mother craved
that he should be brought to trial, and the
Chancellor <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Duprat</span> presented, for the king’s
signature, a list he held ready of judges, who,
chosen from the various parliaments of the
kingdom, were either placed by himself or
devoted to him as having shared in the profits
of confiscations pronounced according to his
desire. The accused was interrogated, and
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Duprat,</span> aware that by delay and chicanery he
could best blind the multitude, under various
pretexts, so lengthened the proceedings, that
they filled four years. On the 9th of August,
1527, he was condemned to be hanged at
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_217' id='Page_217'>217</a></span>
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montfaucon</span>, and on the 12th of the same month,
conducted on foot from the Bastille thither,
passing through the Rue St. Denis, where, in
conformity to an ancient ceremony, criminals
on their way to execution were made stop at
a monastery, and swallow there a glass of wine
and three crusts of bread, and kiss an old
wooden crucifix preserved within it. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Samblançay</span>
submitted to this odious custom without
a murmur; but, arrived at the foot of the
gibbet on which he was to die, he begged that
the hour of his death might be deferred, still
clinging to the belief that a pardon would
arrive, and that the king, who had so loved
him, could not allow his suffering ignominiously
in his old age. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maillard,</span> the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lieutenant
criminel,</span> deferred the execution till darkness
succeeded the long summer day, and, not till
all hope of the king’s pity had departed, bade
his prisoner make his last prayer. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Samblançay</span>
was calm and courageous. “It seemed,” said
his contemporary, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marot,</span> “that himself was
the judge and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maillard</span> the condemned.” He
exclaimed only as he ascended the fatal ladder,
“Would I had served God as I have served
the king!”</p>

<p class='c010' >The road from Milan to Lodi would be
melancholy even without the recollection, that
to the defeat of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Bicocca</span> is bound the fate
of poor <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Samblançay</span>,—the long straight road
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_218' id='Page_218'>218</a></span>
traversing a marshy flat with a wet ditch on
either side, dignified by the Milanese with the
name of rivers. Approaching Lodi, the face
of the country is made gay by rich pastures,
for the meadows which surround it produce all
the cheese called Parmesan, only because the
inhabitants of Parma first made a trade of its
exportation. Our passport examined again,
as carefully as on leaving Milan, we rode to
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Posta</span> through a town cleaner and prettier
than usual: the old innkeeper, at first exorbitant
in his demands, accepting the less
startling prices we offered, but reminding me
of Shylock as he left the room, repeating,
“what was in the bond,”—dinner, tea, breakfast,—and
adding, “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Poco, poco, pochissimo,</span>”
till we lost the sound of his step and voice in
the corridor. We were hardly installed, when
there arrived an Austrian officer with an
orderly to take possession of the stables for an
early hour to-morrow morning, as a regiment
will pass through, coming from <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Bresciano</span> to
join the camp.</p>

<p class='c010' >I was amused by the expression of hatred
to the Germans in the faces of their subjects,
and the contrast between the fair, quiet, but
determined-looking officer issuing his peremptory
command, and the supple Italian, with
his dark eyes and ferocious features, who
received it, and the moment his back was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_219' id='Page_219'>219</a></span>
turned, raised his clenched hand to invoke
imprecations on the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Tedeschi</i>. “Accidenti in
fiume, accidenti per viaggio, accidenti ad ogni
cavallo che stia in questa scuderia,”</span> till his
master came out to soothe his ire by threatening
to turn him away, and then he gave it
vent by beating a poor white goat, the pet of
the sick child.</p>

<p class='c010' >As we had left behind rain and fog, we
walked during the lovely evening to the Pont
de Lodi over the Adda, here broad and rapid.
The same wooden bridge exists which the
Austrians (repulsed and driven back by
Bonaparte) crossed to Lodi, whither the latter
followed in haste to prevent its being broken
by their pioneers.</p>

<p class='c010' >Our guide mentioned with satisfaction the
number of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tedeschi</span> drowned in the Adda. It
flows between flat shores, and derived beauty
when we saw it only from a cloudless sunset,
and the trees which fringe its banks, and were
reflected in its clear water. At night, sleeping
with windows open, as the heat was extreme,
we were wakened by the first serenade which
had greeted us in Italy; the performers had
splendid voices, and sang in parts. The words
of each stanza I could not distinguish, but the
burthen of each was—</p>
<div class='c011'><span class='small'>“<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Son venuti, son venuti, cavalcando, cavalcando;</span>”</span></div>
<p class='c013' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_220' id='Page_220'>220</a></span>
and, whether the compliment was in burlesque
or earnest, I have never heard street music
which so pleased me before. An hour or two
after, the two Austrian officers, who had preceded
their comrades, and occupied a room
near ours, were serenaded also by a fine
military band, so that our rest was disturbed
by sweet sounds almost through the whole
night, and we set off early to make room for
the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tedeschi.</span></p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>2nd October. Lodi to Piacenza.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >A prettier and more shaded road through
a country, almost entirely pasture-land, and
resembling the mildest parts of England. The
little wine they produce is much valued, but
the chief supply comes from Piedmont. We
passed at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Casal Pusterlengo</span> the route which
turns off to Cremona, but, unfortunately, no
one being in sight just then, we were uncertain
as to whether our instincts led right or wrong,
and the distance to the frontier seeming longer
than it had been described, we began to fear
the necessity of turning back, beneath a sun
whose heat was intense to painfulness. A few
carters passed us with their horses, but I have
learned to ask questions with discrimination,
for the brutal incivility of the common Italians
I have never seen equalled. They shout their
disapprobation of our mode of travelling, their
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_221' id='Page_221'>221</a></span>
energy seeming to expend itself in “sound
and fury, signifying nothing;” drive on us their
cart-horses or oxen, or at least act like a
waggoner we came up with yesterday, and
whom I requested to allow me room to pass
on the side where Fanny, who, to his amusement,
was starting violently, would be in no
danger of arriving with me at the bottom of a
twenty feet deep ditch. He told me to manage
as well as I could, as he did not intend to move
an inch. At last, fearing we might ride to
Cremona, we stopped at a cabin door in one
of the dirty villages on our way. My question
was not very politely answered, and the whole
family exclaimed in chorus that we were
wrong, and must turn back; perhaps in ignorance,
though I think in mischief, and, as I
thought so then, we hesitated, and a post-boy
coming up with his horses, (a person always
civil to strangers, who may employ him,)
desired us to ride on, as a few minutes would
bring us to the frontier.</p>

<p class='c010' >This proving true, our passport was examined
at the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cà Rossa,</span> and we were on the
territory of the Archduchess Maria Louisa.
The heat was intense, and they detained us some
time under the sun; the oxen, dragging their
waggon-loads of grapes, passed us by; and
before the village doors the men with their
soiled and sunburned feet were treading the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_222' id='Page_222'>222</a></span>
wine-press as we had seen them doing in the
fields also. At last, Piacenza was in sight;
the dark red city rising on the broad plain
beyond the broad Pô, with the one stone arch,
the relic of a Roman bridge, standing in its
centre, on the deposit of sand and stones; and
the two bridges of boats which we were to
cross, and which should be a relic also, being
extremely unsafe, the boats small, and the
decaying planks they sustain a succession of
hill and dale, over which our horses feared to
advance. The toll is five sous per steed,
which, considering its state, is sufficient.</p>

<p class='c010' >Having ridden in safety, but some dread,
across this uneven and trembling bridge, we
left our passport at the gate, and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douaniers</span>
came smilingly forward. “What is in this
valise?” “Linen.” “And in this?” “Linen
also; will you look at it?”</p>

<p class='c010' >The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douanier</span> smiled, and shook his head,
but made an almost imperceptible sign of
thirst, and D—— gave a silver coin to satisfy
it. There is a frankness about this conduct
which is exceedingly agreeable. One is sure
of giving in the right place, and without
offence, and also of saving trouble at small
cost, for it happened that the only change
we possessed was an Austrian lira, which,
translated, means seventeen sous, three centimes;
and though we were almost ashamed to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_223' id='Page_223'>223</a></span>
offer it, it seemed to content the custom-house
officer perfectly.</p>

<p class='c010' >The sombre streets of this saddest of towns
led us to San Marco, an inn neither good nor
bad, though certainly better than its Milan
namesake, and having fine rooms and broad
staircase, which common cleanliness would
make objects of admiration. Our sleeping
chamber with its dome is of such elegant form
that I should like to transport it afar, but
spoiled with gaudy frescoes on wall and ceiling,
by dirty floor, and ragged furniture. The
eating room, a noble hall, with a range of
pillars down its centre, and hung round with
paintings for sale—some few good, several
curious; luxury and poverty, dirt and elegance,
everywhere blended—even in the yard, which
is an abomination, yet where a coved trellis-work
forms a roof which a splendid vine covers
with its thick leaves, making the loveliest of
ceilings.</p>

<p class='c010' >We walked to the cathedral—a dark red
heavy building, built almost entirely of brick,
with one high tower; an open gallery surmounting
its façade, which exhibits, one above
the other, three ranges of porticoes, the pillars
of the lowest and central one springing from
the loins of guardian lions. Within, above
the principal entrance, is some curious carving.
The church is large without being handsome;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_224' id='Page_224'>224</a></span>
two thirds of the roof, glaring with fresh whitewash,
contrast with the dark grey columns.
The choir has its frescoes still; and there is
a subterranean church which we admired—sombre
and solemn, its arched roof sustained
by numerous pillars, as light and elegant as
those above are massive. We were driven
from the cathedral by two or three guides, who,
next to beggars, persecute strangers in Italy,
following with a pertinacity which defies repulse,
forcing on you a new version of history,
and concluding each sentence by saying, with
extended hand, “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Le sue buone grazie.</span>”</p>

<p class='c010' >In the cathedral, the famous Cardinal
Alberoni (born at the village of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Firenzuola,</span>
which we shall pass through on our way, and
a gardener’s son) was clerk and bell-ringer.
An open piazza surrounds the square, which
we left in search of the citadel, once the palace
and stronghold of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pier Luigi Farnese</span>, who,
invested with the duchy in the year 1545, by
his father Pope Paul the Third, built for his
defence what proved his tomb. Notwithstanding
Paul’s affection for him, he was a man
stained with all vices, and capable of all
crimes. The nobility of his new states, who
under the ecclesiastical sway had enjoyed
great independence, were bowed to the rank
of vassals; and, making his laws retrospective
in their severity, (while he deprived them of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_225' id='Page_225'>225</a></span>
arms, limited their privileges, and forced them
to reside within his city and power,) he commanded
a strict investigation of their past conduct,
and punished its derelictions with heavy
fines or confiscation of property, exercising
the same tyranny of which he had given proof
when five years before he had been sent by the
pope to subdue his revolted province of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Perugino,</span>
the birthplace of Raphael’s master; for
having reduced it to obedience, he devastated
its territory, and put its chief citizens to the
most cruel deaths. The nobles of Placentia,
roused to desperation, at last conspired against
him, demanding and obtaining the aid of Ferdinand
of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Gonzagua,</span> who detested <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Farnese</span>
also. It is said that a man celebrated for
divination of the future presented himself
before <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pier Luigi</span> to warn him of his fate,
desiring him to examine one of his own coins
struck at Parma, as thereupon, and contained
in the same word, he would find the initials of
the conspirators’ names and the destined place
of his assassination. The prophecy was little
attended to at the time, but it was afterwards
observed, that as Plac—— signified Placentia,
it also contained the initials of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pallavicini,
Landi, Anguissola,</span> and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Confalonieri.</span> On the
10th of September, 1547, between thirty and
forty conspirators, in peaceful garb, but with
concealed arms, arrived at the palace as if to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_226' id='Page_226'>226</a></span>
pay their court to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Farnese</span>, who, an old man
before his time, lay in his sick chamber, incapable
of defence or exertion. While they
guarded the approaches, and prevented succour,
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Anguissola</span> sought it and stabbed him.
Apprized of his death by the firing of two
cannon, agreed on as a signal, Ferdinand of
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Gonzagua</span> despatched to Placentia a reinforcement
of troops, and followed himself to take
possession in the emperor’s name.</p>

<p class='c010' >It is said that they flung the corpse from the
balcony into the piazza, and guide-books aver
the balcony is still shown; but of the windows
of the still unfinished exterior, which bears the
ciphers of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pier Luigi</span> and his successor, and
look on the square, not one opens on a balcony.
The inner courts are invisible to
strangers, the citadel being converted to a
barrack, and the other side of the edifice looks
on gardens. A washerwoman, whose door
stood open, allowed me to obtain a view of it
by entering her dirty territory, after we had
made a long and vain tour, for the purpose,
among hot stone walls and ill-scented alleys.</p>

<p class='c010' >The old municipal palace, built in the thirteenth
century, with its quaint architecture,
dark and imposing, forms one side of the
place which contains the two equestrian statues
in bronze, and of colossal size, of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Alessandro</span>
and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ranuccio Farnese</span>.</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_227' id='Page_227'>227</a></span>
Opposite is the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Palazzo del Governo,</span> where,
forming part of an effaced inscription, I could
distinguish the word <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Napoleone.</span> Beneath
the arcades of the first fortress-looking palace,
and around the pedestals of the duke’s statues,
were grouped the market-women, with their
heaps of fruit and baskets of flowers, as if they
were offerings to propitiate the stern warriors
who frown above on their battle-steeds.
Engraved on each pedestal is an inscription,
equally flattering, though deserved differently.</p>

<p class='c010' >Alessandro, brought up at the court of
Philip the Second of Spain, soon distinguished
by his brilliant courage and military talent,
became, after the decease of Duke John
of Austria, governor of the Netherlands, and
profiting by the religious dissensions there,
won over to Spain almost all the resident
catholics. The United Provinces had called
to defend them the Duke of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Anjou,</span> brother
of Henry the Third of France. Alessandro,
whose triumphs had continued almost uninterruptedly,
receiving news of the loss of his
father Octavio, and become by this event
Duke of Parma and Placentia, solicited of the
Spanish court permission to return and take
possession of his sovereignty. Philip refusing
the leave he asked, he prosecuted, with unabated
success, the war in Flanders, till that
in France came to create a diversion. At the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_228' id='Page_228'>228</a></span>
sieges of Paris and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rouen</span> the prince of Parma
was opposed to Henry the Fourth, and returning
from the latter, he was wounded in the arm
before <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Caudebec,</span> and died at Arras of the consequences
of this neglected injury, having
never seen again the province of which he had
become master.</p>

<p class='c010' >His son <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ranuccio</span> was his lieutenant in Flanders
when he expired: though he had shown
courage in battle, he inherited none of his
father’s heroic qualities. In his early youth
in Rome his life had been in danger of closing
violently. Pope <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sixtus</span> the Fifth, informed,
that, despite his severe order against concealed
arms, young <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ranuccio</span> secretly carried
pistols, commanded his arrest, and it took
place as he entered the halls of the pontifical
palace to seek an audience. The <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cardinal
Farnese</span>, his uncle, craved his liberation on the
instant, but in vain. Returning at nightfall
to the presence of his holiness, he renewed his
solicitations even more earnestly. At ten
o’clock the inflexible pope sent to the castle
of St. Angelo his mandate for the young man’s
execution. Unacquainted with the subject of
the message, the cardinal continued to implore,
and at eleven obtained from the hand of
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sixtus</span> a second order,—bearing that, on its
receipt, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ranuccio Farnese</span> should be set free.
Provided with this last, the cardinal arrived
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_229' id='Page_229'>229</a></span>
breathless at the castle of St. Angelo, where,
to his astonishment and terror, he found his
young relative kneeling before his confessor,
and heard that the execution had been deferred
only on his instant prayer for more time to
reconcile himself with God. Whether the pope
had intended merely to terrify his prisoner to
future obedience, or whether he thought, in
the hour which had elapsed, his first command
must have been fulfilled, the cardinal did not
wait to inquire, and the governor yielding
up <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ranuccio</span> in the belief
that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sixtus</span> had
been softened, he forced him to depart from
the papal states without delay. Reigning as
duke in Parma, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ranuccio</span> strove to inspire his
subjects with fear of him, and aroused, instead,
their hatred. When apprised of the discontent
of the nobles, he feigned belief in a wide-spreading
conspiracy, seized on the representatives
of the first families of his duchy, and rid
himself of their future opposition by secret
trials and the block, while he dragged to the
gibbet their adherents and vassals.</p>

<p class='c010' >An even darker trait in <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ranuccio’s</span> life is
his capricious cruelty towards an illegitimate
son, named Octavio, whose noble and brilliant
qualities had won for him the love of all ranks
in his father’s duchy. The duke of Parma
had espoused the niece of Pope Clement the
Eighth, Margaret <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Aldobrandini.</span> His
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_230' id='Page_230'>230</a></span>
unfounded hatred to a wife who, on her side,
could not love one whose severe and sombre
exterior fitly accompanied a distrustful and
avaricious disposition, long kept them separated,
and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ranuccio</span> during this time named
Octavio his heir. As the youth grew up, he
became daily and deservedly more popular,
changing his father’s favour to fear and hatred,
till, having heirs by his wife Margaret, he pretended
a fear that the disappointed prince
might interfere to put his brothers aside;
seized on his person, and commanded that he
should be immured in the fearful prison of
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Rochetta</span> at Parma, where he dragged
through a few wretched years, and died mysteriously.
His father, unjust and ferocious as
he was, yet came to a peaceful end, leaving
the dukedom to the second of Margaret’s sons,
as the eldest proved deaf and dumb.</p>

<p class='c010' >On our return from the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Palazzo Pubblico,</span>
we passed the church of San Pietro, with its
monastery attached to itself, and its convent
on the opposite side of the street; the blank
wall of the first facing the latter’s windows,
barred, grated, and wired, like a prison or a
mad-house, with precaution which seems excessive
where the entrance is voluntary. On
the whole, though we made the tour of all the
other churches we found open, and wandered
till we were weary among the desolate streets,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_231' id='Page_231'>231</a></span>
the day we passed at Placentia seemed a long
one. When night closed in, the silent town
awoke, and parties walked up and down, singing
with most enchanting voices: it is a pleasure
peculiar to Italy.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>4th October.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Left Placentia for <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Borgo San Donnino,</span>
issuing by the old gate and ruined fortifications.
Piacenza received her name, in days
of yore, from her pleasant environs,—now so
changed that she requires new baptism: for the
country, rich and flat, through which our broad,
straight road passes, is interesting only where
the vintagers are employed, and would be bare
of trees but for those planted to receive the
vines. Here and there we found shade from
the sun under a pollarded oak, growing by the
road-side, with the fruit and the festoons of
light green hanging among its dark branches;
far away we could distinguish the Apennines,
but too distant to give boldness or beauty.
At the entrance of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Borgo St. Donnino</span> is its
quaint old church, guarded without by a
strange assemblage of saints, beasts, and nondescript
figures; and before arriving at the
Angelo, which is at the extremity of the little
town, we passed two fine establishments for
mendicity, male and female, once a jesuits’
monastery. The Angelo is the cleanest inn,
and kept by the most honest people we have
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_232' id='Page_232'>232</a></span>
had the fortune to find since crossing the frontier,
the good woman, who lost her husband
a year since, and the head waiter, who has lost
an eye, vying with each other in civility, and
proud of their beds and cookery: still as it rained
pitilessly from our coming till night, we were
reminded that travelling is a melancholy pleasure
as we looked round the large desert
rooms, examined over and over their vile
frescoes, and were glad to talk to the waiter,
and to hear his comments on Maria Louisa,
and how with the higher classes of her subjects
she is no longer popular since the movement
which followed 1830, rousing their desire to be
French rather than Austrians; but adored by
the poor, to whom she is the kindest of sovereigns,
and who feel her charity. The hospitals,
good roads, and fine bridges of her small states,
give proof of her care, and, saving three
months spent yearly at Vienna, her whole time
is passed in her duchy.</p>

<p class='c010' >The violence of the rain prevented our
visiting the ancient church and its curious
tomb of the town’s patron, Saint <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Donnino,</span> who
was an officer of the Emperor Maximilian, and,
having offended his lord by becoming Christian,
fled hither, and was here beheaded in the
year 304.</p>

<p class='c010' >Alberoni’s first step to fortune was the place
of chaplain to the bishop of St. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Donnino.</span></p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_233' id='Page_233'>233</a></span>
The rain ceased, and we left the quiet inn,
taking the long, straight, muddy road to
Parma, passing, ere reaching the latter, the
fine old castle of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Guelfo</span>, a part of which is a
complete ruin, and the remainder with its
ivied walls and square battlemented towers
half concealed among old trees, though close
to the road, forms a fine residence for the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand chambellan</span> of Maria Louisa, whose
family resides there throughout the year. You
know that it was built by the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Guelfo</span> faction,
in opposition to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Castel Gibello,</span> which lies between
Parma and Placentia, though not on the
road we have travelled. These fatal rallying
words were first employed in 1140, at the
battle of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Winsburg,</span> between Conrad the Third,
the emperor, and Guelph the Sixth of Bavaria.
A castle, which had been the nursery of the
dukes of Swabia, was called Gibellin, and the
Christian name of Guelph had long been one
of predilection in the house of Bavaria. The
latter sought the pope’s alliance. Even when
the political animosity between them had died
away, old affections and old hatreds continued
to spring up in gratitude or in vengeance for
benefits and injuries received by either’s ancestors.
From Guelph the First, of Bavaria,
sprang the house which gave monarchs to
England.</p>

<p class='c010' >Beyond <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Castel Guelfo</span>, we crossed the fine
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_234' id='Page_234'>234</a></span>
bridge, which seems of endless length, commenced
by Napoleon, and finished by Maria
Louisa, across the desolate and desolating
Taro, which, now shrunken and still, winds
through its winter-bed, like a rivulet in a
desert, and, shortly after, arrived at Parma,
built on the river of the same name, which we
traversed two or three times as we rode to the
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Paone,</span> whither we had been recommended,
and which, though a bad inn, we bear with
patiently, as its owners are civil, and stabling
excellent: for, under present circumstances,
our own lodging is not that held first in importance.
A portrait of the Santa Madonna
hangs against the wall at the lower end of the
stable,—the lamp, which burns before it,
serving the double purpose of doing her
honour and lighting the mangers.</p>

<p class='c010' >The rain returned in torrents, not to be
braved; and the windows of our dirty rooms
command a view of only a small portion of
the square. As I leaned out, looking at a
dirty café just opposite, and in our own alley,
and a yawning Italian woman, with her dark
neck bare, as usual, enjoying, with her two
elbows on a cushion, the “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">dolce far niente,</span>”
which so chafed ourselves, there passed beneath
a long procession, headed by a few priests, and
composed of men, who wore, over their usual
dress, a species of friar’s cloak and cape of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_235' id='Page_235'>235</a></span>
oilskin, with a silver badge, resembling a coffin
plate, hung to the left side. They went
silently along under the pouring rain, a bareheaded
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capucin</span> walking beside the last, and a
crowd following. I asked a servant who they
might be. They belonged, he said, some
being clerical, some laymen, to the brotherhood
of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Buona Morte,</span> and were on their
way to visit a criminal condemned the next
morning to die. He was guilty, the waiter said,
of a “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">brutto delitto,</span>” and the story was, indeed,
one exhibiting the unrestrained passions which
are the heritage and curse of Italy.</p>

<p class='c010' >He was a peasant thirty years of age,
married to a wife of five and twenty, to whom
he had been long attached, and father of an
infant but a few weeks old. In the course of
this summer he unhappily became acquainted
with another and a depraved woman, but
whom he determined to marry, and his resolution
irrevocably formed, he returned home
and from her presence one evening, deliberately
sawed his wife’s head from her body
with a pruning-knife; took measures for her
burial which he believed would prevent discovery,
and went from her corpse to her old
father to mourn with him for her early death.</p>

<p class='c010' >We shall leave at daybreak, and probably
make no stay at Modena, as we return by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_236' id='Page_236'>236</a></span>
same road, when I will satisfy my own curiosity,
and any you may feel likewise.</p>

<p class='c010' >You know the anecdote of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cambacérès</span>,
told by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montgaillard.</span> “On the 11th of April,
1814, he put down his liveries and imperial
representation, and in a spirit of legitimacy,
justice and humility, which cannot be sufficiently
praised, signed a deed of renunciation
to the title of Prince of Parma in presence
of a notary! and remitted this deed to the
Austrian cabinet, so that the Empress Maria
Louisa and the court of Vienna will, on this
head, have nothing to fear!!”</p>

<p class='c010' >At the village of St. Ilario, at which we
arrived after crossing a long narrow bridge
over the Enza, is the frontier. We were detained
some time, but the duke’s <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">doganieri</span>
are the first and only who have a touch of
modesty about them, for they do not stretch
forth the hand for coin. Fed our horses at
dirty <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Reggio,</span> Ariosto’s birthplace; the poor
noble, the unsuccessful lawyer; the great but
ill-recompensed poet, to whose <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Orlando Furioso</span>
the Cardinal <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ippolito d’Este</span> said,
“Master <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Louis,</span> whence gathered you together
such fooleries?” but better appreciated
by the wild robber chief <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pacchione,</span>
when Ariosto (sent by Duke Alfonso to purge
the mountainous district of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Garfagnana</span> of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_237' id='Page_237'>237</a></span>
lawless bands who infested it, and having so
legislated as to succeed, and in a brief space
of time to bow or soothe the turbulent to submission)
was passing on horseback, and with
six or seven domestics only, along a narrow
pass, when at a sudden turn, and grouped in
the shadow, he perceived a number of men of
suspicious appearance, and hurried by, knowing
his party’s inability to cope with theirs.
The chief of the band, however, who watched
him go past, arrested his last follower by the
bridle, and inquired the name of the nobleman.
The domestic replying “Ariosto,” armed
as he was, he joined the charger at a bound,
and the poet checked him suddenly, uncertain
as to the motive of his haste and the action
which might follow.</p>

<p class='c010' >The robber doffed his cap and bowed respectfully,
asking pardon for having failed to
salute him on his passage as being then unacquainted
with the person of one whose fame
was familiar to him, and having made him
the most polite offers, took his leave.</p>

<p class='c010' >It was Ariosto, who, endowed with genius,
not with fortune, engraved over his small house
the inscription:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c015'   >
    <div><span class='small'>SMALL DWELLING SUITED TO ME, OBNOXIOUS TO NONE, IN</span></div>
    <div><span class='small'>NO RESPECT MEAN, RAISED AT MINE OWN COST.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013' >and who replied to the question, why he who,
in his Orlando, could so well describe splendid
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_238' id='Page_238'>238</a></span>
palaces with porticoed courts and marble
halls, had built a dwelling so humble? “It
is easier to gather together words than stones.”</p>

<p class='c010' >On our left hand (the road conducting
thither following the course of the torrent
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Crossolo,</span> which washes one side of the town)
is the village of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Correggio,</span> the birthplace
and the home of Allegri, to whom it has
given a name which is not to die—the man
who it is said had no master: who studied
nature in her grandeur and her grace; of whom
a modern writer has observed that his love of
childhood, his study of its anger, its joys and
tears, so exact that he was wont to stop to
sketch in his walks the groups he met at play,
gave him in its representation such purity of
conception, such brilliancy and delicacy of
touch, that he seemed to paint with the breath,
while over his female forms there is diffused
a divinity, a celestial grace, belonging to beings
of a higher order, as if he had painted in
prophecy. Never rich, ill paid for his mighty
works, having received but about £20 and
his food during the six months his labour
lasted for the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef d’œuvre</span> of his life, the St.
Jeronimo, he proceeded one day of 1534 to
Parma to solicit that the remainder of a
sum due for the frescoes of the cupola of the
cathedral might be paid him, and received
there £8 in copper money. Impatient to bear
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_239' id='Page_239'>239</a></span>
it to his family at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Correggio,</span> he started on
foot to carry it thither, arrived heated and exhausted
by the enormous weight, was seized
with acute fever and died at forty.</p>

<p class='c010' >The appearance of the little city of Modena
is most prepossessing, regularly built and
clean, with wide streets and handsome buildings,
a pleasant impression increased by the
magnificent rooms and extreme civility of our
inn San Marco.</p>

<p class='c010' >With Modena is connected much historical
interest. The famous Countess Matilda, the
church’s most pious benefactress, and the
pope’s most attached adherent, was its sovereign
in 1054, and in her strong castle of
Canossa near <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Reggio,</span> she received Pope
Gregory the Seventh, yielding to him her
powerful protection on the news that Henry
the Fourth of Germany, the excommunicated
emperor, was on his way to seek a personal
interview with the pontiff, preferring so to do
to awaiting the decision of his holiness the
following year at the diet-general of the empire
to be invoked at <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Augsburg</span> for the purpose
of his ban or absolution. There exists
a village of the same name, where the impregnable
fortress of Matilda arose at that
time. The princes of the empire had obliged
the unfortunate Henry to consent to abjure
the marks of his rank as well as its power; to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_240' id='Page_240'>240</a></span>
enter into no church, which, as a man condemned
by the church, his presence might
sully; and to travel without suite or dignity
till such time as his fate should be decided.</p>

<p class='c010' >Feeling that in the assembly of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Augsburg</span>
that decision would be fatal, notwithstanding
the danger of traversing the Alps at that
season (Christmas), Henry the Fourth departed
for Italy, accompanied by his empress,
and by Prince Conrad, then a boy, and who,
in after days, was to raise the standard of
revolt against the father, whom Henry, his
second and best beloved son, was also, when
most trusted, to betray, usurp his empire, and
imprison his person, and finally refuse to it
the rites of burial. The emperor arrived at
Canossa, and presented himself at the first
gate, for the fortress was surrounded by a triple
wall, and the ground then covered with snow.
He was allowed to wait a long time and alone;
the few who attended him being forbidden to
approach; and the gate being at last opened
to him, he was wholly at the mercy of his
enemies, a consideration which did not subdue
his courage or change his purpose, for it is
said of him, that in the sixty-six battles he had
fought, he had always, save when betrayed,
come off victorious. Admitted within the
second court-yard of Canossa, he was bidden
to put off his shoes and the royal robes which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_241' id='Page_241'>241</a></span>
he wore, assuming in their stead a plain
woollen tunic; and the monarch having obeyed,
he was allowed to remain in this court three
days, though in the month of January and in
the Appennines, exposed to the severity of the
weather, and receiving food only late at night,
as if forgotten by the proud pontiff. The
fourth morning Matilda interceded, and
Gregory the Seventh allowed himself to be
softened, admitted the emperor to kiss his
holy foot, and gave him absolution on such
humiliating terms, that they were shortly after
broken through, and Henry excommunicated
once more.</p>

<p class='c010' >Nicholas of Este, duke of Modena and
Ferrara about 1400, was the injured husband
who beheaded Parisina; and Alfonso of Este,
whose reign commenced in 1505, was married
to Lucretia Borgia, of infamous memory. It
was his brother the Cardinal Ippolito who was
Ariosto’s unworthy patron. Rival in a love-affair
of his natural brother <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Don Giulio,</span>
Ippolito heard its object, who was a lady of
Ferrara, praise the beauty of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Don Giulio’s</span>
eyes, having preferred him for her lover. As
his brother returned from a hunting party, he
was surrounded by assassins guided to meet
him by this unnatural relative, and the eyes,
whose lustre the fair lady of Ferrara had
praised, torn from their sockets in his presence.</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_242' id='Page_242'>242</a></span>
Before arriving at Modena, and on the river
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Secchia,</span> we rode through the wretched town,
and beneath the strong stern towers of the
fortress of Rubiera, within whose walls died
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ottobon Terzi,</span> who, from a <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">condottiere,</span>
striving to rise to be an independent sovereign,
seized successively on Parma, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Reggio,</span> and
Modena, pillaged Placentia, beheaded sixty-five
citizens of Parma, but at last, desirous of
peace, as the Marquis of Este opposed to him
the brave <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Attendolo Sforza,</span> consented to a
conference at Rubiera. The chief and the
noble arrived, each followed by a few chosen
knights, and among those of the latter was
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Attendolo.</span> Excited by sudden passion, or
perhaps obeying a command unworthy of him,
in the midst of the peaceful discourse Sforza
sprang forward and stabbed <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ottobon Terzi.</span>
Those who accompanied him fled, and the
corpse (transported thither and mutilated by
the people’s fury) was dragged through the
streets of Modena.</p>

<p class='c010' >So much for the striking traits of her history,
we shall know her features better on our return;
for here, as at Parma, it has rained the
livelong day, and we leave early to-morrow.
It is the first time since I arrived on Italian
ground, that the comfort of an inn has made
me wish to stop for repose.</p>

<p class='c009' >Mirandola is not on our road although at
no great distance, on the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Secchia,</span> and forming
part of the duchy of Modena; near it are two
other villages, called Concordia and Quarantola.
It is said that Euridice, grand-daughter of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_244' id='Page_244'>244</a></span>
Emperor Constantine, and wife of Mainfroy
the Saxon baron, in the first of the three became
mother at a birth of three noble boys,
from which strange fact it was named Miranda.
Growing up in perfect harmony, the place
which they inhabited was called Concordia;
and years after, when their descendants, increased
in number, in a neighbouring town
mustered forty knights, it took from them the
name of Quarantola. This legend you may
doubt or believe in; but the family of Pio and
Pic, sprung from Euridice, produced in 1463 the
phœnix, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pic de la Mirandole</span>, who, at ten years
of age, held the first place among the poets
and orators of his day; and in 1486, at Rome,
published a list of nine hundred propositions
on “all that is or can be known,” offering to
argue their truth with any such learned personages
as could be induced to meet him there,
proposing to defray the expenses of their
journey and their sojourn. The envy of
these denouncing him as dangerous and a
heretic, he endured persecution for a time
and fled to France, but justifying himself, returned
to Florence and died there the day that
Charles the Eighth made his entry, and having
known him in France, sent his physicians, who
strove vainly to save his life. He left large
legacies to his domestics, and the remainder of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_245' id='Page_245'>245</a></span>
his possessions to the poor, and was not thirty-two
when he died.</p>

<p class='c010' >This is the fête of the Virgin. Before
leaving Modena, the landlady took some
trouble to convince me that the barber opposite,
occupied in shaving several black faces, was a
Jew, as a good catholic would on no account
so labour to-day. Outside the town, we met
numbers of peasants carrying the tall <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cierges</span>
intended as offerings at her altars, ornamented
with flowers and ribands. The toilette of
the women, who wore their best clothes, had
an elegance about it, the lace or embroidered
handkerchief covering, in guise of mantilla,
the head and shoulders, and the clear worked
muslin apron tied on over the bright petticoat.
On the chapter of beauty, however, their
“glory has departed.” Since leaving Milan,
we have seen but few females not plain to
ugliness, and but seldom among the men one
of those dark faces so peculiarly handsome,
notwithstanding its doubtful expression. The
dirt of the lower classes is so excessive and
indescribable, that, as they make their toilette
before their cabin doors, the entire breadth of
the road seemed scarce sufficient to save from
contamination.</p>

<p class='c010' >Having passed through St. Ambrogio, and
over a fine bridge which crosses the Tanaro,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_246' id='Page_246'>246</a></span>
we entered on the papal territory. At the
barrier we paid two pauls per horse, the same
at each of the two bridges, but on carriages
the tax falls heavily; and at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Castel Franco</span> are
the pope’s custom-house and passport office.
Truly the subjects of his holiness lack conscience.
One touched our baggage; “What
have you here?” and to the usual reply,
“Linen; will you see it?” rejoined, “On no
account, but we will drink your health.” Then
came up another to whisper “they were not
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">insieme</span></i>,” and that the first was a narrow-minded
man, who shared nothing with a comrade;
and thirdly, a soldier bringing the passport
murmured as he delivered it, “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Le sue
buone grazie.</span>”</p>

<p class='c010' >Arrived at Bologna as the sun set, passing
on the right hand the long brick arcade, which,
three miles in length, is carried up the hill
to the church containing the Virgin’s most
precious picture, painted by St. Luke; and
riding beneath an archway which bears an
inscription in Napoleon’s honour, whitewashed
for the sake of effacing it, but restored by the
late heavy rains. We went, as recommended,
to the Pellegrino, but it was full and has no
stables, and to the Aquila, which had accommodation
for our horses, but none for ourselves,
a circumstance it did not think proper to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_247' id='Page_247'>247</a></span>
communicate till the latter were on the road to
their quarters.</p>

<p class='c010' >A voice in the crowd said “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Pace,</span>” but
it was overruled by another answering, “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San
Marco;</span>” and as the latter was nearest, we
went thither, and found it full also. The inn
opposite, a branch of this, as belonging to the
same master, and called the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tre Mori,</span> had
still a disposable room, so said the innkeeper,
and, weary of wandering, we agreed to take it
if possible. He retreated with a bow within
his own premises, and we were consigned to
the care of his <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">direttore</span></i>, the great man’s great
man at the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tre Mori.</span> The room, which was
small and stifling, and exactly opposite a hall
in which domestics were noisily dining, had
been occupied, I think, by servants also, and
left unarranged at their departure. The only
answer to the bell was “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Patienza,</span>” a virtue I
should have summoned to mine aid till morning,
despite the inn’s dirt and incivility, but
that D—— came in dismay to say that our
poor comrades were lodged in a crowded
stable, without space to lie down, and next
kicking horses, one of whom had lamed his
neighbour the night before. To run the risk
of a like accident to ours was not to be thought
of—the warlike Fanny, with open mouth and
ears laid back, and Grizzle, with her heels,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_248' id='Page_248'>248</a></span>
were prepared to resent any insult from the
tall carriage horses, or even to take the initiative
if necessary; and Italy being a place where
even bribes are vain to induce an attendant to
practise care, D—— remained standing beside
the surly groom, while I sallied forth on a
voyage of discovery, having changed my dress,
and summoned to conduct me a poor <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">facchino,</span>
who had carried our baggage into the inn—a
dwarfish wretched being we noticed for his
civility, and who had since remained leaning
against the wall in the hope of further employment.
I desired him to be my guide to
La Pace, and we threaded the winding and
porticoed streets at a rapid step, as I feared it
might grow dark ere our return, and San
Marco being at one end of the town, La Pace
is at the other, in a broader street, and better
air, near the gate we shall pass through going
to Florence. Arrived at the hotel, I found
with satisfaction that its mistress was a Frenchwoman;
and seeing that not only our horses
could have a private stable, but that the house
in accommodation, as well as in civility, wholly
differed from the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tre Mori,</span> we hurried back;
the little guide telling his history, and how
he had been left an orphan, and with three
sisters, he “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">povero ragazzo</span>” (for the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">ragazzo</span>
is, like the Irish boy, named for life) and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_249' id='Page_249'>249</a></span>
they had struggled, and nearly starved for a
time, and then established a good character,
and got on in the world, till now (in his Sunday
attire) he was another man.</p>

<p class='c010' >We asked for our bill of an hour, and,
though explaining the motive of our departure,
endured insolence in return, paying with
Christian meekness the moor’s exactions, which,
for our horses and ourselves, charged such
items as might have been fair the next morning.
As we walked out, we passed an English
gentleman, who stood on the inn steps holding
a bill of interminable length, the innkeeper of
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Marco</span> and the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">direttore</span> of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tre Mori,</span>
one on each side, like Scylla and Charybdis,
and the Englishman, foaming with the powerless
fury of the sea in like situation, for the
worthies were uncivil and positive. Escaped
from their fangs, our horses led by the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">ragazzo,</span>
we arrived at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Pace</span> at dusk, crossing on
our way the fine <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Piazza Maggiore,</span> most striking
in that imperfect light, with the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Palazzo
Pubblico,</span> and the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Palazzo del Podestà,</span> and the
unfinished <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">façade</span>
of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Petronio,</span> occupying
three of its sides, and the giant’s fountain,
with its statue of Neptune by John of Bologna,
built, not in the centre of the square, but in its
angle, or rather on a “place” of its own, a
kind of supplement to the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Piazza Maggiore,</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_250' id='Page_250'>250</a></span>
facing the buildings of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Palazzo Pubblico,</span>
where they extend beyond it.</p>

<p class='c010' >I have heard Bologna criticized for its unending
arcades, which give it in my opinion a
claim to admiration; a studious and solemn
character, making it resemble some mighty
cathedral and its cloisters. La Pace retains
the name it bore when a resting-place for
pilgrims on their way to Rome; the large
vaulted kitchen was then the refectory, and
the upper stories of the building have still
the same distribution as in those days. Our
hostess has known some of life’s vicissitudes.
Her father had a place in, I think, the financial
department, whose revenues sufficed for the
comforts of his family, but, wishing to retire,
he exerted what interest he possessed to get a
friend, who promised compensation, named in
his stead. Having succeeded, this man not
only refused to fulfill his part of the agreement,
but having borrowed and given no
security for all the ready money the old man
possessed, he finally turned into the streets,
from the shelter which had been their own,
the father and young daughter. The latter
wandered over Paris during the day, vainly
seeking employment, which, owing to her
youth and disbelief in her story, was everywhere
refused her. At last, night coming on,
and those who passed examining the forlorn
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_251' id='Page_251'>251</a></span>
girl with curiosity or contempt, in despair,
and ashamed to beg, as she crossed the Pont
Royal on her way back to the spot where she
had left her father, she suddenly resolved on
suicide, and was about to throw herself into
the river, when her arm was caught by an old
officer, who forcibly held her back, gravely
remonstrated with her, and passed on. Softened,
and her purpose changed, she knocked meekly
at several doors, and at last found shelter with
a poor portress, who received herself and her
father for charity. She next took service with
a lady resident in the hotel, and accompanied
her to Italy. There, after some years, she
married the head-waiter of the inn of San
Marco, and they embarked their savings in
La Pace. Her father followed when she
quitted France, but he had grown childish
from misfortune, and died shortly after the
change in his daughter’s prospects. He used
to wander miles away from the inn, saying he
would go back to France. The fat black
terrier, who sits so petted and caressed on a
chair in the kitchen, was his follower and
guardian. One day, after a vain search for
the old man, he was found sleeping on a
mattress in a peasant’s cabin, with the dog
sitting at his head: he had walked farther,
thinking to pass the frontier, and fatigued,
and unable to speak the language, he sank
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_252' id='Page_252'>252</a></span>
down at last before the cottage which gave
him its hospitality. I think she said it was
his last excursion.</p>

<p class='c010' >The Neptune of John of Bologna holds a
place once occupied by a statue, by Raphael,
of Pope Julius the Second, and raised by
his command shortly after his first conquest of
Bologna, in 1406, but the pope was represented
with so haughty an aspect, and in so menacing
an attitude, that the original of the statue
had hardly quitted them, when the indignant
Bolognese struck it down. The church of
St. Petronio, though unfinished, and likely to
remain so, has an imposing aspect, and is of
ancient date, as commenced in 1590. It possesses
its patron saint’s entire body, the head,
which only was wanting, having been bestowed
by Pope <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Benoit</span> the Fourteenth. The presence
of this relic caused a strange mistake on
the part of the learned German Meibomius,
who, believing all the works of the satirical
writer Petronius preserved at Bologna, made
a long journey thither to behold his manuscripts,
and was greatly disappointed when
led to the shrine.</p>

<p class='c010' >In this church was Charles the Fifth, the
emperor, crowned king of Lombardy by Clement
the Seventh;—kissing the same papal
foot he had before held captive, and creating,
after the ceremony, two hundred knights, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_253' id='Page_253'>253</a></span>
the list of whom are included the names of
several noble families still existing in Bologna.</p>

<p class='c010' >The palace of King Enzio opposite still
bears the same name as when the prison of
the unfortunate young man, illegitimate son
of the Emperor Frederic the Second, and
dethroned king of Sardinia. The Bolognese
took him captive, and would never restore his
freedom more, for he pined within these walls
twenty years, and died in the year 1262.
There is a legend which would make the
family of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Bentivoglio</span> of royal origin: it recites
that there was a fair young peasant
enamoured of Enzio, and who, by bribes or
stratagem, found means to see him in his confinement.
She loved, and was faithful to him,
and brought forth a son, who, by favour likewise
was sometimes allowed to be carried to
his father’s arms. The sad prisoner was wont
to hold him on his knee, and murmur to the
boy while he caressed him, “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ben ti voglio, O
ben ti voglio.</span>”</p>

<p class='c010' >When he died, he left him all his disposable
property, and the youth adopted as a family
name the words he had so often heard repeated
by his father.</p>

<p class='c010' >The towers of Asinelli and Garisenda, which
serve us for landmarks in our perambulations,
are at the gate of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ravignana,</span> and at no great
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_254' id='Page_254'>254</a></span>
distance from the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Piazza Maggiore.</span> They
are remarkable for their bending position:
the first, towards the west, is but five feet out
of the perpendicular; it was built in 1109,
and is three hundred and seven feet high.
The last is in height but one hundred and
forty-four feet from the ground, but its inclination
towards the east is far more considerable.
It was built about a hundred years later, and
its threatening and most awful position has
remained unchanged since the sinking of the
foundation first caused it.</p>

<p class='c010' >We went to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Ignace,</span> which was formerly
the convent of the Jesuits’ Noviciate, now the
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Accademmia delle Belli Arti,</span> and I saw in its
handsome <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salles</span> many fine pictures, the most
celebrated being Raphael’s St. Cecilia, and in
which, though beautiful, I was disappointed. I
believe it suffered repair when it came to Paris,
then was repainted the sky, which now starts
from the canvass, before the heads of which it is
the back ground. You would have smiled to see
the man who came when we rang for admittance,
these halls being open to the public
except on festivals. We asked if entrance were
possible to view the St. Cecilia. “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Possibile,
si!</span>” he answered; “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">ma sa ella che questa sia
festa?</span>” and held the door close, fearing we
should pass him without agreement made; but
I said, “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Capisco.</span>” And he then threw it wide,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_255' id='Page_255'>255</a></span>
and when he came out again, stood bowing with
hands outspread.</p>

<p class='c010' >We had been employed in making a few
purchases: for, notwithstanding that in every
town, Milan included, I have visited and questioned
the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">speditori,</span> of our baggage we
have heard nothing since the day it quitted
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vevay</span> to precede us in Italy. Whether it has
crossed the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Simplon</span>, or is domiciliated in its
torrents, remains unknown to me, and the linen
contained in our valises at present constitutes
our wardrobe.</p>

<p class='c010' >We made the tour of most of the churches,
the cathedral among the rest, which is modern
and glaring, but owns the last fresco of Louis
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Carracci</span>. The church of the Dominicans contains
the tomb of King Enzio, or Hensius; and
the old church of San Stefano, the only antiquity
whose existence is certain in Bologna,
and thought to have been a temple dedicated
to Isis. Though this is the 7th of October,
the heat continues excessive, and the arcades,
which exclude the sun by day, also prevent
the free circulation of air at night. The
stifling and ill-scented streets make bad promenades;
and the dirt of the population of
Bologna passes description. We walked into
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Petronio</span> this evening: it was decorated
for the festival, and the altar, a blaze of wax-lights,
contrasted with the gloom of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_256' id='Page_256'>256</a></span>
spacious aisles. The priests, in their rich
robes, moving before, and the multitude
kneeling on the pavement, had a fine and
solemn effect; but the infected atmosphere
made it impossible to stay more than a few
moments within the curtain which falls before
the entrance. On our return to La Pace, and
as I walked along the broad and dimly-lighted
corridor on which the apartments open, I saw
it was occupied by a party, and forth from it
issued our poor dwarf <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">facchinoo</span> in the best
coat of which he had spoken, and a new
capacity: for he said this was his own band,
and its music, he being one of the performers,
was certainly delightful.</p>

<p class='c010' >We expected letters to-day, but were disappointed,
and the kind-hearted landlady, fancying
my anxiety proceeded from some mistake
in the forwarding of our funds, begged very
earnestly that her bill might remain unpaid
till our return from Florence. She regrets
her own country, though she has stayed here
long enough to lose its accent. Her Italian
rivals strive to ruin her, a laudable purpose
in which they generally succeed, against the
French interloper who comes within their circle
with civility and better accommodation.</p>

<p class='c010' >They are a strange compound of ferocity and
cowardice, these papal vassals. They bring
to my mind an anecdote told me of their
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_257' id='Page_257'>257</a></span>
brethren at Ancona, by our friend <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capt. de
V——l,</span> whose conduct at Lyons I mentioned
to you, and I write it here, as a story of the
pope’s troops will not be misplaced at Bologna.
I give it you in almost his own words,
as he was present there at the time:—</p>

<p class='c010' >The <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Conte P——i</span> commanded a battalion
of infantry quartered in the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">lazzeretto</span> of
Ancona, which is a building of considerable
size, and easy to defend, as the sea surrounds
it. When the 66th took during the night possession
of the town, the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">lazzeretto</span>, the pontifical
battalion, and the quiet commandant, were all
three forgotten. In the morning, enraged at
the neglect, he angrily inquired whether the
French general was aware of the presence of a
battalion in the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">lazzeretto</span>. “Very probably,”
was the reply. “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Allora,</span>” said the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Conte
P——, “si vuole una capitulazione; perchè
nella circostanza è cosa necessaria e <em>militare</em>!
Sono comandante; la capitulazione la
voglio, vado dunque a visitare il general Francese
e la capitulazione si farà.</span>”</p>

<p class='c010' >Such being the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Conte P——’s</span> warlike views,
he was escorted to the presence of Colonel
Combes, who then commanded the 66th, and
laughing heartily, willingly satisfied the military
scruple of the gallant officer.</p>

<p class='c010' >An anecdote of a different time, but of the
papal troops also, animated by the same spirit,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_258' id='Page_258'>258</a></span>
I must mention here:—After the revolution
of —22 or —23, the Neapolitans, failing to
prove their allegiance to their new government,
yielded difficult passes it would have been
easy to defend, retreating before the Austrian
army, and continually defeated till their king
was replaced on his throne. Asked why they
had allowed themselves to be so easily conquered,
they replied that their cannon had
been taken. “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Più non abbiamo canoni; e
senza canoni che si può fare?</span>”</p>

<p class='c010' >It was shortly after the arrival of the French
at Ancona, and in November, 1836, that the
cholera broke out there, and believing it infectious
as well as epidemic, the Italians had the
barbarity to wall up the doors of the houses
in which the first sufferers lay, introducing
through the windows, and at the extremity of a
pole, the food or medicine thought necessary.
Our friend’s lodgings looked on the hospital,
wherein, when the panic had in some measure
subsided, the sick were admitted—to die—either
from the virulence of the malady, or the
measures adopted for its cure: for abstinence
was so strictly practised, that many perished
from starvation. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de V——l</span> certifies,
what would otherwise seem incredible, that
of all carried within its walls one only issued
forth alive. This was a strong, powerful man,
who attacked with cholera, but to a slight
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_259' id='Page_259'>259</a></span>
degree, was borne to the hospital, and, laid in
one of the beds, fell asleep,—and waking in the
morning, refreshed and hungry, asked for food.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Come!” said the Italian nurse; “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">quì non
si mangià; sarebbe darsi la morte!</span>”</p>

<p class='c010' >Feeling the weakness of convalescence, the
patient, though he insisted, lay quiet and soon
slept again, and through almost the entire day
and night which followed; but the second morning
his hunger was no longer to be borne with.
He implored food, and received the former
answer: “No food is given in the hospital.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Watching his time, therefore, the unfortunate
man slipped from his bed, seized the first
garments within his reach, rushed through
doors happily for him unfastened, and into the
street and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grande Place,</span> where he saw a friend
standing, and flung himself into his arms,
demanding bread, as he was starving. He was
fed and cured,—a solitary exception; yet the
cruel and ignorant populace incurred more
danger by an hour of fanaticism than they
could have done in a month of charity. The
French soldiers had soon constituted themselves
nurses, performing frictions and other offices
the Italians feared, and saving many. So great
was the cowardice, that a consecrated wafer
was presented to a dying man by his priest at
the extremity of a pair of pincers. The only
active means they adopted was the ordering a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_260' id='Page_260'>260</a></span>
procession in honour of Our Lady of Ancona,
attired for the occasion in a white robe,
spangled with golden stars. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capt. de V——l</span>
and his company formed part of the procession,
it always happening, he assured me,
that he was on duty as the Madonna’s guard
whenever she came forth. This Madonna is the
same of whom Napoleon, when playing his
part on this stage, asked an interview, and who,
after a conference of some length, was observed
to drop a tear!! Though it was the month of
November, and the operation a dangerous one
in times of cholera, by the clerical command
all constituting the procession, saving our
friend and his men, marched barefoot. Arrived
at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grande Place,</span> on a kind of scaffolding
raised there, appeared a priest to address the
multitude; who vociferated with the whole
power of his lungs, commanding that they
should prostrate themselves on the cold pavement,
and telling them that this scourge had
come upon them because they observed fasts
less strictly, and because their faith and confidence
in their clergy had declined.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Each of you,” he exclaimed in conclusion,
“ask pardon of heaven with meekness and
penitence; say frankly, I am a sinner, a thief,
an assassin; therefore pardon me.” It would
seem he knew his congregation. Of the poor
wretches who assembled that day, swarms had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_261' id='Page_261'>261</a></span>
perished ere the close of the next; but there
is, not far from Ancona, a small town or village,
whose name I forget, which escaped the pestilence
by reason of a miracle performed by its
patron saint, the details of which <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capt. de
V——l</span> saw on a printed <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">affiche.</span> When disposed
to avert evil from his native place, the
saint pushes up the lid of his heavy tomb, and
agitates above it his hands streaming with
blood. The adjutant of the 66th, talking with
a man of this town, asked if any one really
believed it had happened.</p>

<p class='c010' >“<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giacchè,</span>” answered the Italian, “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">le dico
che ho veduto, veduto cogli occhi miei.</span>”</p>

<p class='c010' >We are to start to-morrow, and I sent on a
bandbox, and a man who came the length of
the street to fetch it, grumbling when I had
paid him well, I took from the table, which
was in a corner of the half-lighted room, what
I thought a few more <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">baiocchi,</span> and among
them bestowed, most unworthily, a Napoleon.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>9th October.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Left Bologna a little after sunrise, our
good-natured hostess having got up early to
prepare our coffee, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la Française,</span> with her
own hands; the horses pleased as ourselves
to escape from their hot captivity. We
rode for some distance still over the plain
along the brink of the torrent Savena, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_262' id='Page_262'>262</a></span>
from Pianoro, the first post, the route ascends
undulating in a succession of steep rises and
falls, far more wearisome to horses than the
broad way which, sweeping across the Alps,
forced aside or pierced through every obstacle.
The hills, some bare as those of Burgundy,
clothed with chestnut, as we advanced, not
having the bold character of the Alps’ mighty
and lonely masses, but swelling like wave
beyond wave, and in their details losing
grandeur. On the whole, though admiring
and enjoying the pure mountain air, and
passing some spots of romantic beauty, (particularly
one where the road was carried under
a wall formed by the high cliff, while before
us, on a tall crag, stood a lone church, and on
the right hand far below, lay the valley, with its
green hills close crowded and dotted with
pleasant habitations,) our first day’s journey
over the Appennine almost disappointed me
in its tranquil beauty, as compared with the
wild and grand Swiss passes. The heavy
oxen toiling on their way, as they preceded
the post-horses of travelling carriages, or the
mules of waggons, added to the picturesque
aspect of the country. Its breed of cattle is
peculiarly beautiful, having the dun hide and
black legs of the deer. We were to sleep at
Lojano, a village under a hill with a fine
gorge stretching below. I recommend the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_263' id='Page_263'>263</a></span>
Pellegrino, the new inn on the Bologna side,
clean and comfortable and having civil masters,
and not the Posta, known to me only as
bearing a bad character, and being immured
in the dirty town. Our horses had a separate
and good stable, enjoying the thick bed of
fern, here substituted for that of Indian corn
leaves, which made so bad a one at Bologna.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>10th.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >A lovely morning, and beauteous ride from
Lojano through chestnut woods, which cover
these hills, laden with the fruit now ripe and
dropping, which, as it forms the chief food of
the poor, the pretty peasant girls were busily
employed collecting in their baskets. Those
we saw were mostly fair and light-haired, and
if they wanted the bold dark eyes of the
Bolognese dames, their more delicate features
would have served the sculptor for model.
The heat became excessive as we approached
Scaricalasino; the view thence is superb, we
could distinguish the chain of the Alps and
the plains of Lombardy, but not, as I hear is
sometimes possible, the Adriatic. Past the
town the road grew wilder and the ascents
more rapid, and we shortly arrived at Filigare,
the frontier, where the grand duke has built a
new and handsome edifice for police station
and custom-house. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pietra Mala</span> is at no great
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_264' id='Page_264'>264</a></span>
distance, with its dirty town and church on a
crag, and inn to which is linked a robber
story. About half a mile to the right, a peasant
pointed out the place occupied by the
flame, which is so brilliant at night, as to light
the neighbouring mountain. It covers a space
of fourteen feet square, on a stony but fertile
soil, as the vegetation almost touches the fire,
which emits blue and red flames, and the earth
beneath has neither crack nor hollow; it is
believed by some naturalists to be the forerunner
of a fearful volcano. At a short distance
from <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pietra Mala</span> there is also a cold
spring called by the natives “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Acqua Buja,</span>”
which takes fire when approached by a lighted
torch.</p>

<p class='c010' >The day was oppressively warm, but we
came up with a poor man driving his mule
laden with pears and figs, the most delicious,
and dismounted to rest under the shade of
some of the bare crags which hereabouts rise,
divested of plant or tree, broken into seeming
pinnacles and towers, till we found we excited
attention, and thought it unwise to do so any
longer, as the Appennines have been of late
in their loneliest parts scarcely safe for travellers.
Hereabouts there is an inn, good apparently,
but which I should hardly choose
from its utter solitude, and we soon arrived at
the summit of this mountain, the highest on
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_265' id='Page_265'>265</a></span>
our route; formerly dangerous, as the wind,
which rushes down the gorge in sudden gusts,
often swept off carriages. It is now, at the
places of peril, protected by high walls, of the
necessity of which we were aware, even to-day,
as it blew freshly there, though the temperature
below was burning and breathless. A
long winding descent, commanding lovely
views into wooded defiles, succeeded, and we
passed the spot where the old road crosses
ours; it was abandoned because impossible to
protect it in the snow season.</p>

<p class='c010' >Arrived at Montecarelli, a lone inn in a
pretty situation; the village itself is some
hundred yards farther. I cannot say that we
dined or rested well, though the beds were
clean and the people civil, and certainly
honest, for neither here nor at Lojano could
door or window be fastened or even closed.
We were kept waking by carts and roulage
waggons arriving late and starting early,
aided by the poor patient oxen, labouring on
with their meek heads bound to the yoke, and
the lantern tied between them. As they took
their short snatches of rest in the stable which
held our travellers, and accidents were not
impossible, and the pump beneath our bedroom
was all night in motion, we gladly went
on at dawn to escape the heat, at least in
part. Our last day’s journey was the most
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_266' id='Page_266'>266</a></span>
interesting. Montecarelli left behind, we
wound through groves of old oak up and
down abrupt hills, catching glimpses through
the trees into valleys on either side; to the
west the sky was blue and pure, but eastward,
as the sun rose, it shone on the surface of the
mist which lay like a broad lake in the hollow,
the green tops of the hills surmounting it like
its islands. The clouds are more agreeable
as well as picturesque far than near; for, riding
through them, the country was completely
veiled, and the chill unpleasant and penetrating.
About four miles from Montecarelli,
we passed <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Le Maschere,</span> which appears a good
inn; and near it the charming villa of some
Florentine, its garden walls covered with
roses, adjoining a ruined arch and grey tower,
whence, following the slope of the hill, descends
a noble cypress avenue. The views, as we
issued from fog and into a burning atmosphere,
grew at each step more Italian in their character,
with villas on the wooded eminences,
and here and there the umbrella pine rising
above its fellow trees. Having left behind
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cafaggiolo,</span> where on the right hand there is
a turreted castle, which belongs to the duke
and resembles a fortress, our road descended
to a valley, skirting a bright and narrow
river, enclosed between hills where we
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_267' id='Page_267'>267</a></span>
journeyed beneath a sun it was difficult to believe
that of October.</p>

<p class='c010' >Here again by the road-side we found vineyards
and their refreshment, and figures or
pictures of saint and Virgin perched on poles
among the vines to protect them from blight
or storm; those I ate had been under the
care of St. Antonio, and he had proved a good
husbandman. Our horses suffered again from
the small fly, and we were glad to ascend the
mountain and exchange their presence and
the extreme heat for its fresher air. Climbing
slowly, as the way was steep, suddenly from
behind a cabin at the angle issued forth to
meet us an ill-dressed suspicious looking
party; the eight or ten foremost carrying
guns, the stragglers who followed, thick sticks;
and as one must needs be imaginative in the
Appennines, we began to think that robbers
we had heard of were indeed abroad, and
(having no arms) to speculate on the speed
of our horses, and the necessity of galloping
through the group, as we had no intention of
riding back again. Having mustered courage
to run away, we were prevented making any
undue exertion by the banditti turning peaceably
down a bye-path; we asked a little girl,
who stood at the lone cabin door, who they
were, and she said <i>Cacciatori</i>, <em>sportsmen</em>.</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_268' id='Page_268'>268</a></span>
At last the steep succession of sunny hills
ascended, refreshed by no shade, and riding
under heat such as I never yet felt, we saw
Florence below with her domes and towers
rising out of the mist the heat made, backed
by mountain above mountain, broken and
numerous as the billows of a troubled ocean.
On either side, as we rode down this last hill,
the country was covered with vine and olive,
sounding prettier in description than they
look in reality; and the terraced gardens of
the villas we passed were gay with a profusion
of summer flowers, and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laurier-rose</span> with
its double and beautiful blossom, growing in
the open ground and shooting up against the
blue sky. In compensation, the heat was
scarcely to be borne; the horses devoured
with flies, ourselves blinded with sunshine,
and (having left two miles from the city the
Campo Santo with its cluster of sombre pines
on the right hand, and entered, one after the
other, several villages) persecuted by beggars
and by a succession of vile odours, which all
the winds of the Appennines cannot waft away.</p>

<p class='c010' >On the left hand, before entering Florence,
to which it is the nearest villa of importance,
the avenue, whose grass grown road is lined
with broken statues, leads to the deserted
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Palazzo Borghese.</span> Riding beneath the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_269' id='Page_269'>269</a></span>
triumphal arch, raised in 1739 (in honour of the
Emperor Francis the First when he came
hither, yet only grand duke of Tuscany, and
in imitation of the Arch of Constantine), we
passed through the ancient <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Porta San Gallo,</span>
whose date is 1284, and into the city. A boy
guided us over the flat and dangerous pavement
to the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Palazzo Bertolini,</span>
now the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hôtel du Nord,</span>
and opened about a week since by
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ci-devant</span> cook of Jerome Bonaparte,
having moderate terms and fine apartments,
only too comfortable, as this weather we would
gladly dispense with their thick carpets. Our
dresses changed and dinner ended, and the
horses, for which there was no room here,
lodged at Huband’s livery stables, I was too
impatient to remain enclosed in the hôtel till
morning, and, notwithstanding fatigue and
the unusual heat which keeps Italians within
doors, went out to receive my first impression
of Florence; and though to me, as it does to
many, it brought disappointment, with its
streets crooked and narrow, its quays so inferior
to those of Paris, and its Arno now
shrunk in its bed to little better than a ditch,
its ancient buildings and irregular squares
have historical interest and picturesque combination,
which make full atonement.</p>

<p class='c010' >The <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Piazza della Santa Trinità</span>, on which
our inn is situated, is near the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Palazzo Vecchio</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_270' id='Page_270'>270</a></span>
and far famed <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Duomo</span>. On our way to the
last, we crossed the Place, at an angle of which
the former stands, not in the centre, as a
decree ordained that the spot once covered by
the razed palace of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Uberti</span> should remain
vacant for ever, in memory of the traitor’s
infamy. Built in the year 1298, it frowns
unshaken by time, a square fortress with
embattled walls of jutting stones, surmounted
by one high tower, and the nine escutcheons
which bear the coats of arms of the city’s
various possessors ranged below the battlement.
Crouching on the steps is the lion of
Florence, holding its place in the city’s armorial
bearings, from as early a period as the
lily which blooms on the two first of these
recording escutcheons. The arms of Napoleon
and the grand dukes are last in order, and
among those which mark the factions of
Guelph and Gibelline, those of Charles of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Anjou</span> and King Robert of Naples; of the
wool-carders and the Medici, the merchant
monarchs. There is one bearing the monogram
of the Saviour, for Nicholas Capponi, in
the year 1527, and at a period of excitement
when no temporal sovereign seemed strong
enough to sway the disobedient Florentines,
proclaimed Jesus Christ their <em>king</em>, in a grand
council composed of a thousand voters, of
whom twenty, opposing the election, formed a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_271' id='Page_271'>271</a></span>
minority!! The colossal statues which guard
the entrance, the fine fountain with its Neptune
and marine horses, beside its steps to the left,
and beyond on the Place the royal statue of
Cosmo mounted on his war-horse, to the
right, as we stood opposite the citadel, the
Loggia d’Orgagna with its three arches, light
and yet solid, which once served for tribune to
the orators of the republic, and now shelters the
beautiful Sabine group of John of Bologna—the
Judith beheading Holophernes, and the
proud Perseus of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Benvenuto Cellini</span>, with
the stern palace and the ancient prison tower,
which rises above the roofs of the irregular
houses opposite—and the two parallel lines of
colonnaded buildings, which extend from the
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Palazzo</span> and the Loggia to the quay, and
contain in their attics the Galleria de’ Medici,
make this the most striking portion of Florence.
We saw it to advantage beneath the
bluest of skies, and a sun which shone red and
intense on the burning pavement, as if it had
been August, calling up, alas! the succession of
ill scents which betray an Italian town.</p>

<p class='c010' >Passing the post-office, and turning down
the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Via de’ Calzajoli,</span> we arrived shortly on
the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Piazza del Duomo</span>. The cathedral and its
elegant bell-tower, beside it, but detached,
and St. John the Baptistery, opposite the
unfinished façade of the cathedral, which has
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_272' id='Page_272'>272</a></span>
been painted in fresco, now washed away by
rain, occupy the centre of a fine open space,
which shows to advantage their beauties or
peculiarities. Is it sacrilege to think that its
monstrous dome seems to weigh down the remainder
of the building; that its mass of
black and white marble wants relief, or what
the French call <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mouvement</span></i>, to give it light and
shadow; that the octagon temple, with its
pointed roof, once pagan, cased in marble, and
become that of St. John, is heavy and ungraceful?
St. John possesses the bronze doors, so
beautiful in their workmanship: that facing
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">St. Maria del Fiore</span> executed, when but
twenty years old, by <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ghiberti</span>, whose model
was preferred to those of Donatelli and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Brunelleschi</span>,
and of which Michael Angelo said,
that it was worthy to be the portal of paradise.
On either side of this door hang, as a trophy,
chains once belonging to the gates of Pisa,
and suspended here in memorial of the victory
gained over Pisa by the Florentines in the
year 1362.</p>

<p class='c010' >Entering this square from the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Piazza del
Gran Duca,</span> there is on the left hand a small
church, its exterior not distinguished from the
houses which adjoin it. It was growing dusk,
and at the door stood attendants with torches,
I fancied for some festival within, but, while
we lingered, there issued thence a funereal
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_273' id='Page_273'>273</a></span>
procession, the most solemn I have seen; the
mourners in their long sable robes, and hoods
forming masks, with openings for the eyes
only, two and two, bearing torches in their
hands, following the priests, carrying banners,
and the coffin, with its velvet draperies, and
followed in turn by the clerical attendants, in
white robes and crimson capes, slowly sweeping
round the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Duomo</span> on their way to the Campo
Santo; all burials being performed at night
and without the town.</p>

<div class='c008'><span class='small'>October 13th.</span></div>
<p class='c009' >Went to the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Duomo</span> to hear the celebration
of high mass, which was not performed at the
principal altar, now under repair, but in one
of the side chapels. The effect of the cathedral
is grand from its immensity. Divided into
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_275' id='Page_275'>275</a></span>
three aisles, the octagon choir, surrounded by
its marble balustrade, is placed beneath the
dome, with which it corresponds, and the
spaces, octagon also, on either side, form the
cross, each containing, as well as that behind
the choir, five chapels. Though richly ornamented
with paintings and stained glass, and
the marble statues of prophet and apostle;
though the unfinished figure of Pity, behind
the high altar, is the work of Michael Angelo;
the pavement round the choir laid after his
designs; the frescoes of its cupola by Vasari;
it yet disappointed me, seen after the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Duomo</span>
of Milan. The construction of this church,
named <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Santa Maria del Fiore</span> from the lily,
the arms of Florence, occupied a space of one
hundred and sixty-nine years; it had been
commenced in 1298, and the year 1417 arrived
before any of its successive architects had
raised a stone of that cupola, to which Michael
Angelo said, when, before quitting Florence
to build that of St. Peter’s at Rome, he paid
it a farewell visit: “Adieu, I am going to
build your likeness, not your equal!”</p>

<p class='c010' >In Vasari’s Life of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Filippo Brunelleschi</span>, he
gives interesting details of the struggles to
persuade, and the success when permitted to
act, of this extraordinary man. He was a
Florentine, but residing in Rome, and appreciated
there at the time of which I speak; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_276' id='Page_276'>276</a></span>
the members of the “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Opera del Duomo</span>,”
weary of their architect’s indecision, agreed to
summon him; and the syndics of the woollen
trade, who supplied the funds, offered to his
consideration all the difficulties of execution
which had been presented to themselves.
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Brunelleschi</span> answered vaguely: he said, “That
as the temple was dedicated to God and to the
Virgin, there was little doubt of their conferring
on him who was destined to conclude this
great work the science and invention necessary;”
and added, he doubted not if himself
were concerned, that he might find resources
and master obstacles. He advised that they
should convoke at Florence a congress of the
most skilful artists of Italy, France, and
Germany, and confide the direction to the
ablest when all should have given counsel.
He forbore, however, to bestow his own,
evaded making the models demanded of him,
and returned to Rome, where he passed the
next three years in the most arduous studies,
all tending to the solving of this problem. In
1420 there met, as he had advised, a company
of foreign and Tuscan artists at Florence, and
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Brunelleschi</span> left Rome to join them. The
meeting was held in the church, the members
of the “Opera,” the syndics of the woollen
trade, and the principal citizens being present;
and it was amusing to hear the strange
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_277' id='Page_277'>277</a></span>
propositions made. Some spoke of constructing the
dome of pumice-stone, for the sake of its
lightness; a number adopted the idea of supporting
its centre by a pillar like the pole of
a tent. Several advised the first raising
within the church a mountain of earth, mingled
with coins of small value, so that when the
dome should be built over it, the multitude
would gladly free the church of its presence
on account of that of the money. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Brunelleschi</span>
alone condemned all plans proposed, asserting
the necessity of a double roof; and following
up his own idea, without explaining the
manner of its execution, entering into minute
details, and not comprehended by the assembly;
till at last, after having been several
times prayed to retire, and refusing to depart,
the consul’s pages laid hands on him, and
pushed him forth as a madman. Still undiscouraged,
he resolved on persuading separately
the consul, and some of the members
and more enlightened citizens, and persevering
till he succeeded, it was decided that the choice
to be made should lie between himself and
the foreign architects; and another meeting
was convoked for the purpose of hearing their
arguments for the last time.</p>

<p class='c010' >It was then that took place the famous dispute,
which had an egg for subject. The
rivals of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Brunelleschi</span> desired that he, as they
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_278' id='Page_278'>278</a></span>
had done, should exhibit plans and models.
The Florentine refused, but he dared them to
stand an egg upright on the marble table,
saying, that he who should succeed in so doing
could certainly raise the cupola also. Each
attempted the feat vainly, and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Brunelleschi</span>,
his turn come, quietly striking one end of the
egg against the table, it stood erect on its
cracked shell. Those present exclaimed, “We
could all have done as much;” and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Brunelleschi</span>
answered, “Very true, and you could raise
the dome if you had my model!”</p>

<p class='c010' >The syndics were henceforth decided, but
the annoyance of the artist was not yet over.
It was agreed that his work should proceed to
a certain height, with a promise only of continuing
if it so far satisfied. When this first
condition was fulfilled, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lorenzo Ghiberti</span>, who
had attained celebrity by the bronze doors of
the Baptistery, was named his colleague—having
powerful protectors in Florence; and
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Brunelleschi</span>, in vexation and fury, had almost
abandoned an enterprise whose difficulties
were thus to remain, while its glory would
vanish. Determined on ridding himself of his
coadjutor, he, after a time, pretended illness,
and, instead of arriving to superintend as
usual, remained in his bed, complaining of
pains in his side—submitting to frictions and
remedies. The master workmen applied for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_279' id='Page_279'>279</a></span>
directions to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ghiberti</span>, who answered that they
must wait his colleague’s recovery, as he could
issue no order singly, and evaded confessing
that he neither knew <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Brunelleschi’s</span> plans, nor
had seen his model.</p>

<p class='c010' >The latter’s malady proving obstinate, the
workmen repaired to his bedside, but obtained
neither orders nor satisfaction; for he turned
to the wall, saying, “Have you not <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ghiberti</span>,
and can he not work a little in turn?” As it
was vain to urge him farther, they departed,
as he desired, to seek his fellow architect, but
as time went on, and a stop was decidedly put
to the building, the workmen began, as he
had hoped, to murmur, and to doubt <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ghiberti’s</span>
capacity, and at last resolved on going in a
body to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Brunelleschi’s</span> lodgings, to make
known to him the cessation of the work, the
disorder ensuing on <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ghiberti’s</span> ignorance, and
the unhappy consequences to them who were
poor, and dependent on their exertions for the
support of themselves and their families.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Wherefore is <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ghiberti</span> idle?” asked the
mock patient; “have you not him to issue all
needful directions?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“He can do nought without you,” said the
workmen.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Ah,” rejoined <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Brunelleschi</span>, “without his
co-operation <em>I</em> could proceed very well.”</p>

<p class='c010' >At last, weary of idleness, urged by his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_280' id='Page_280'>280</a></span>
friends, who had whispered abroad the cause
of his malady, and represented that he would
more easily free himself of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ghiberti</span> by recommencing
his labours, and proving his colleague’s
ignorance of architecture, he returned to his
post of director, but seeing that his patron’s
support retained <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ghiberti</span> in office, notwithstanding
what had past, he resolved on forcing
his retreat through his humiliation. “I might
have died in my late illness,” he said, “and
had I done so, you have still <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ghiberti</span>, whom
heaven preserve to you; but as our salary is
shared equally, may it please you that our
labours be divided also, in order that each of
us may prove his anxiety for the republic’s
glory. There are now two difficulties to overcome—the
construction of scaffoldings, solid
and convenient, and adapted for the labours to
be prosecuted within and without the dome,
and the establishing the chain of masonry
which is to bind together the eight sides of
the cupola; let him choose one of these, leaving
the other to me.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Not daring to refuse, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ghiberti</span> decided on the
latter as most easy of performance, and relying
on the cupola of St. John as a pattern, and
the master masons for advisers. The scaffoldings
of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Brunelleschi</span>, entirely different from
any used before, were so happily invented, and
ably executed, that their models were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_281' id='Page_281'>281</a></span>
preserved in the cathedral stores. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ghiberti</span> had
established the stonework on one of the eight
sides; but his colleague, visiting it in company
of the members of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Opera del Duomo</span>,
on his return analyzed its construction,—pointed
out its defects,—proved its want of
solidity,—and said, in conclusion, that <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ghiberti’s</span>
building and salary should be alike put
a stop to.</p>

<p class='c010' >The latter was, however, not discontinued;
but <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Brunelleschi</span>, thenceforward, was sole director
of the works. Observing that the higher
they rose, the more time his masons lost, he
imagined the constructing of small houses of
refreshment on the dome itself, and thus prevented
their long absences. The height of the
dome, from the cathedral floor to the ball, is
three hundred and twenty-seven feet, and the
whole was terminated twenty years after <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Brunelleschi’s</span>
death, and in conformity with his
designs.</p>

<p class='c010' >I saw with regret that some of the best
statues, those of Florentine saints which ornament
the lateral aisles, are in <i>carta pesta</i>;
the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Giovanni Gualberto,</span> who holds a cross,
and whose expression and execution are alike
beautiful, is crumbling away.</p>

<p class='c010' >On the right hand, entering the church, is
the portrait in marble of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Brunelleschi</span>, sculptured
by his scholar; and near it that of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giotto</span>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_282' id='Page_282'>282</a></span>
the painter and sculptor, the architect of the
Campanile, and the labourer’s son, whose
genius was first guessed by the artist Cimabue,
when crossing the fields on foot he found him,
then a shepherd boy, occupied in tracing on a
stone the figure of one of his lambs. He took
him to Florence, where he became his pupil,
soon leaving far behind both his master and
all the artists who had, till then, enjoyed
celebrity,—studying nature, which they had
neglected, and grace, which they had misunderstood.
He was celebrated in the verse of
his contemporary and friend Dante, whose tomb
he afterwards decorated when the poet died in
exile. The Campanile was commenced in 1334,
and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bas reliefs</span> and the statues which ornament
the interior of the edifice are in greater
part the work of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giotto’s</span> own chisel, and the
remainder executed after his designs.</p>

<p class='c010' >Beyond his and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Brunelleschi’s</span> portrait, and
the mausoleum of a Florentine bishop, there
is placed, above a side portal of the edifice,
a monument in honour of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pietro Farnese</span>,
captain of the Florentines, which has, at first
sight, a ludicrous effect, the equestrian statue
being highly gilded; but the animal, which the
warrior bestrides, meek-faced and long-eared.
Chosen by the Florentines for their general
against the forces of Pisa, the 11th of May,
1363, he led an army against theirs; and his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_283' id='Page_283'>283</a></span>
horse killed under him, the sole charger found
disposable was an ignoble mule, mounted on
which he gained the victory, took prisoner the
Pisan general, and the greater part of his
army. The 19th of June following, seized by
plague, which then desolated Tuscany, he
died the same night, deeply regretted by the
Florentines.</p>

<p class='c010' >Near the transept, but on the left hand, is
the portrait of Dante by <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Orcagna,</span> with a
sketch of his triple kingdom, and a view of
Florence: it is curious as painted in 1430, at
the suggestion of a Franciscan monk, who in the
church gave lectures on the Divina Commedia.
This strange old painting recalls an eventful
story; his fame predicted at his birth, in
1265, by the astrologer Brunetto Latini; his
love awakened at nine years of age for the
Beatrice, who was his dream through life;
his bravery as a soldier and ability as an
ambassador, and his banishment,—for Charles
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Anjou,</span> entering Florence, finding Dante of
the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Bianchi</span> party, (which he had espoused,
says his biographer, principally because the
wife, whom he had married and parted from,
belonged to that of the Neri,) he issued
against him two sentences, which still exist,—the
first condemning to spoliation and exile, the
last to be burned at the stake with his friends
and adherents; a wanderer over a world whose
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_284' id='Page_284'>284</a></span>
admiration could not compensate for absence
from his country; in 1304, in company of his
fellow exiles, striving and failing to force a
way thither; everywhere received kindly, but
wearying his hosts by the proud temper which
misfortune soured, or by the very fact of being
unfortunate,—for in the company of women he
was gay and gentle, though bitterness of retort
has been reproached to him by those who
provoked it: misunderstood through life, his
history is concluded in the verse of Byron:—</p>
<div class='c011'><span class='small'>“Ungrateful Florence! Dante sleeps afar.”</span></div>
<p class='c012' >Above a side door of this lateral aisle is the
monument of Peter of Toledo, vice-king of
Naples, and father of Eleonora of Toledo, the
broken-hearted or the murdered wife of the
first duke Cosmo; and nearer the principal
entrance, still on the left hand as we face the
altar, there is a marble mausoleum, distinguished
by a cross, from whose extremities
spring lilies, and placed between two eagles.
It is believed to contain the ashes of Conrad,
the traitor-son of that Emperor Henry the
Fourth, who at Canossa was the penitent and
victim of Pope Gregory the Seventh, and the
Countess Matilda; urged to treason against
his father by Urban the Second, Gregory’s
successor, and after eight years of civil war,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_285' id='Page_285'>285</a></span>
dying despised for the revolt which the court
of Rome had instigated, and for the calumnies
which he had promulgated against his father
as excuse for his unnatural rebellion.</p>

<p class='c010' >In the octagon space, to the left of the choir,
is the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sagrestia de’ Canonici,</span> that which once
sheltered <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lorenzo de’ Medici</span> from the fury of
his foemen, the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pazzi</span>. They had determined
on crushing a power which the Pitti had
attempted, but vainly, to extinguish in the
person of his father Pietro.</p>

<p class='c010' ><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sixtus</span> the Fourth was personally his enemy,
and with his assent was obtained the co-operation
of the archbishop of Florence, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Francesco
Salviati</span>. Two fêtes were given by the conspirators:
the first at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Fiesole,</span> the second at
Florence,—to which the Medici were invited;
but Julian each time failed to come. The
day and place at last appointed were the 26th
of April, 1478, in the cathedral; and the
moment that of the elevation of the host, as the
brothers never failed to attend high mass on
Sundays, and it was difficult to be certain of
their presence together, and off their guard,
elsewhere. The <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">condottiere Montesicco</span> was
charged with the murder of Lorenzo; Bandini
and Francesco Pazzi with that of young Julian,
and no circumstance of the plot having transpired,
its success seemed certain. When, however,
the mercenary soldier had been informed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_286' id='Page_286'>286</a></span>
of the time chosen, in horror excited by the
sacrilege, not the murder, he refused the part
assigned him, and yielded its performance to two
priests less scrupulous. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Francesco Salviati</span> was
to remain near the old palace, to take instant
possession on receiving news of the brothers’
death. Giacopo Pazzi, drawn into the conspiracy
against his will, was commissioned to
call the citizens to arms, and proclaim their
freedom. Mass had begun, and Lorenzo was
present; but Julian had not appeared, and
Francis Pazzi and Bandini went to seek him,
and accompanied him to the cathedral, conversing
with him gaily as they went along,
and, arrived there, Francis Pazzi embraced the
young man with seeming amity, but to assure
himself that he wore beneath his peaceful
attire no cuirass which would interrupt the
passage of steel. The moment arrived, Bandini,
who stood ready, plunged his dagger
into young Julian’s breast, who staggered a
few steps and fell; but Francis Pazzi, rushing
upon him also, inflicted so deep a wound on his
own thigh, as incapacitated him for further
effort. The priests attacked Lorenzo, but
Maffei only succeeded in slightly wounding
him in the throat; and drawing his sword and
defending himself gallantly, he fought retreating,
till succour came, and the assassins fled,
and took refuge with his friends in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_287' id='Page_287'>287</a></span>
sagrestia, where Bandini, who, having murdered
Francis Neri, as well as Julian,
advanced to try his firmer hand against Lorenzo’s
life, could not reach him. Meanwhile
the Archbishop Salviati, proceeding to take
possession of the palace with his thirty followers,
and Giacopo Pazzi, arriving on the
public square with a hundred men-at-arms,
found the Medici party too strong, were taken
or fled. The former, in his cardinal’s robes,
with <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Francis Poggio,</span> the historian’s son, was
hanged from the windows of the palace; and
Francis, who had dragged himself home, and
striven to mount his horse, but, weak from pain
and loss of blood, had sunk down on his bed,
was brought thither, half clothed as he was, and
suspended by the archbishop’s side. His doom
inflicted with haste and carelessness, death did
not immediately follow, and in his prolonged
agonies he gnawed the breast of his neighbour.</p>

<p class='c010' >Torn in pieces by the infuriated populace,
or flung from the castle-battlement; or by the
hand of the executioner, there perished seventy
persons. Giacopo Pazzi, who had escaped, was
taken in the mountains, brought back to Florence,
and hanged also. Only the pope’s
nephew, the Cardinal Riario, who, too young
to be made privy to the plot, had been conducted
to the city and the cathedral to lure
the Medici more surely thither, was spared
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_288' id='Page_288'>288</a></span>
to appease the pontiff, having first suffered
insult and injury; but Paul the Fourth, nevertheless,
placed Florence under interdict for
the violent death of her archbishop, Salviati.
Vasari mentions that the artist, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andrea del
Castagno</span> was selected to fulfill the decree
issued,—bearing, that all who had taken part
in the conspiracy should be represented, with
the ignominy they merited, on the façade of
the old palace. Andrea, being under obligation
to the Medici, executed this painting with
so much energy and truth, representing all the
personages hanged by the feet, but in varied
and admirable attitudes, that his work
awakened the curiosity of the town and the
enthusiasm of connoisseurs, while it bestowed
on him the nickname of “Andrew of the
Hanged.”</p>

<p class='c010' >From the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Duomo</span> we went to the Baptistery,
entering by the northern door, which, as well
as that facing the cathedral, is the work of
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ghiberti</span>, and opposite which is the little pillar
of St. Zanobi, recalling a miracle his ashes
performed when they were transported to
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Santa Maria del Fiore</span>:—The bier touched by
accident a withered elm, which then occupied
the place since yielded to the column, and its
dead branches were instantly covered with
leaves!! Above these celebrated doors are
bronze statues of remarkable workmanship.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_289' id='Page_289'>289</a></span>
It was in the year 1293 that the edifice was
encrusted with marble, at the expense of the
shopkeepers of Florence, who were its patrons;
and young <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Arnolfo di Lapo,</span> entrusted with
the restoration, also agreed to preserve and
employ all ornaments and sacred fragments
he should find at his disposal: and this may
account for the irregularities within, for the
mingling of Composite with Corinthian architecture,
and the difference existing in the
sixteen granite columns which, ranged within
the circle, support the terrace carried round
the temple. Between these pillars are the
figures of the twelve apostles, and two statues
representing Natural and Revealed Religion,
the former very beautiful, in carta pesta. The
mosaics of the dome were chiefly executed by
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giotto’s</span> pupils, and are admired for their
execution. I think I never saw anything more
horrid than the Last Judgment, a representation
of which fills a large circle in the part of
the dome immediately above the high altar,
and its fine group in white marble of St. John
supported by angels, and ascending to heaven.
The Saviour (so the artist has named an ignoble
figure of gigantic size) is placed between
the elect and the damned, which last a devil of
extraordinary shape is employed in thrusting
down his large throat whole, with an eagerness
which threatens indigestion.</p>

The story of Joseph occupies another compartment;
the creation of the world and the
deluge, and the life of John the Baptist, fill
the remainder, making sad burlesque of serious
things. The tomb, which, entering at the
northern door, is on the right hand (its statue
of gilded bronze representing the buried
pontiff, and the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">basso relievo</span> bearing the
three Cardinal Virtues), is that of John the
Twenty-third; his name was Balthazar Cossa,
a Neapolitan of noble family, but scanty fortune,
and in his youth a pirate. Abandoning
the sea, and the trade it offered him, ambitious,
clever, and bold, he became an ecclesiastic,
found means to introduce himself to
Boniface the Ninth, and, obtaining his favour,
was by him made cardinal and his legate at
Bologna.</p>

<p class='c010' >His conduct was scandalous and tyrannical,
and discontented the successor of Boniface;
yet the imperious legate resisted, and with
success, the papal power; and Alexander the
Fifth, to whom, when opposed to Ladislas,
king of Naples, he rendered great services,
received him into favour and intimacy. The
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ci-devant</span> corsair was nevertheless suspected
of poisoning his benefactor in his impatience
to take his seat. He was crowned at Bologna,
as John the Twenty-third, in 1410; but Ladislas
first menaced Rome, next, in perfidy, recognised
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_291' id='Page_291'>291</a></span>
John as pope; but when the latter,
believing in his sincerity, had allowed his best
troops to depart thence, made his entry during
the night; and John, laying aside his sacred
character, found barely time left him to
mount his horse and escape towards Florence.</p>

<p class='c010' >Though Ladislas was shortly after poisoned
by his mistress, the tiara remained ill secured
on the brow of the pope. A council-general
was assembled at Constance; a list of important
accusations presented against him;
and finally, having fled in disguise from Constance,
been delivered up by the duke of
Austria, (forced to the act by the Emperor
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sigismund</span>,) he found himself obliged to ratify
the sentence which declared him to have caused
scandal to the church, and deposed him from
his dignity, forbidding the faithful to obey
him.</p>

<p class='c010' >Martin the Fifth being elected in his place,
John sought him at Florence, and, on his
knees, both implored pardon and fully ratified
the act of abdication. Martin received him
kindly, and created him dean of the Sacred
College. The short time which intervened
between this circumstance and his death, he
spent in retirement and literary pursuits, for
he wrote verses of some elegance, referring to
his gone-by greatness and solitary close. He
died in 1419, about six months after, and from
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_292' id='Page_292'>292</a></span>
his friend Cosmo de’ Medici received a splendid
burial.</p>

<p class='c010' >Continuing our walk, we passed before the
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Palazzo Riccardi,</span> now the Public Library,
built, in 1430, on the designs of Michelozzo,
by Cosmo, father of his country, and sold to
the Riccardi family by the Grand Duke Ferdinand
the Second. Nearly opposite the
Baptistery, on the northern side, in the time
of Lorenzo the Magnificent, its gardens were
filled with the fine antiques which have since
formed the Florentine Gallery, and then drew
within the sphere of the owner’s liberality the
young sculptors of Florence. The most famous
among these was Michael Angelo, whose noble
name, for he was a descendant of the family of
Canossa, is well nigh forgotten in that his
genius ennobled more. Born in 1474, in the territory
of Arezzo, his father, Buonarotti Simoni,
opposed his taste for the arts, till he recognized
that the natural bent of his son’s mind
was too decided to be thwarted, and Michael
Angelo, who, fearing his father’s severity, had
worked assiduously, but in secret, was placed
as a pupil with the Ghirlandai, the most celebrated
painters of the time.</p>

<p class='c010' >In the year 1489, Michael Angelo, then
about fifteen, wandering over Florence with
his friend Granacci, was by him introduced
into the gardens of the Medici. To study the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_293' id='Page_293'>293</a></span>
rich antiques it contained, he abandoned the
workshop of Ghirlandaio, and it was here that,
at that early age, he executed, from a mutilated
antique, the head of the Fawn, now admired in
the galleria, supplying in his copy, which surpassed
the original, the parts wanting, and
adding details whose truth belonged to himself
only.</p>

<p class='c010' >It was this juvenile work which awakened
Lorenzo’s wonder. He said jestingly to the
boy, “You have made your fawn old, and yet
his teeth are perfect; do you not know, that
to old people some are always wanting?”</p>

<p class='c010' >The duke had hardly departed, when he
broke away a tooth with his chisel, and
hollowed the gum so that it appeared to have
dropped from age.</p>

<p class='c010' >On Lorenzo’s return, noticing the alteration,
and admiring the youth’s intelligence,
he assigned him apartments in his palace,
treated him as his own son, and continued to
protect him till he died. During this time,
four years, he had profited by the society of
learned men and artists, who frequented the
Medici palace, and by the instructions of
Angelo Poliziano, then entrusted with the
education of Lorenzo’s son, Pietro, who, profiting
by them less than his young comrade, was
the puerile successor of a great father.</p>

<p class='c010' >Michael Angelo was eighteen years of age
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_294' id='Page_294'>294</a></span>
when his friend died. Feeling his loss deeply,
he quitted the Medici palace, and returned to
his own home, where he shut himself up, alone
and inactive, during several days, and then,
finding by chance a block of marble, which
had long lain exposed to wind and rain, he
produced from it a Hercules. During the
severe winter which ensued, he yielded to the
childish wish of Pietro, and lost his time by
making statues of snow, not through the complaisance
of a flatterer, but such feeling of
love to the dead as excuses the failings of the
living representative. He was again lodged
in the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Palazzo</span>, now Riccardi; but the Medici
family, in consequence of Pietro’s conduct,
was driven from Florence, and the artist
thought it wise for a time to depart also, and
did not again inhabit the palace, which had
been the home of his boyhood.</p>

<p class='c010' >In the year 1715, Francisco Riccardi enlarged
the palace considerably, without altering
its architecture—enclosing within its walls the
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Strada del Traditore</span>, so named from <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lorenzino
de’ Medici,</span> the murderer of Duke Alessandro.
On the site his house had occupied
were constructed the stables. The close of
Alessandro’s life forms one of the darkest
portions of Florentine history.</p>

<p class='c010' >An instrument in the hands of Charles the
Fifth, the emperor; by him chosen to rule
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_295' id='Page_295'>295</a></span>
Florence, to prepare its possession by Austria;
a bastard of the Medici, as being son of
Lorenzo, duke of Urbino, and an African
woman, whom it is said he poisoned that she
might no longer witness to his base birth;
he was one-and-twenty when, accompanied
by the emperor’s delegate and the imperial
decree, which named him chief of the state, he
entered Florence.</p>

<p class='c010' >Gay and clever, popular for a time with
the people on account of these qualities, and
losing their favour through a depravity of
conduct which did not even respect the barrier
of their convent walls, he excited the indignation
of the republican party, as well by his
vices as by his tyranny and system of espionage,
which in their houses, as well as in
the streets, made it dangerous for the citizens
to hold communication by word or sign.</p>

<p class='c010' >Louisa Strozzi, the young daughter of
Filippo, chief of this powerful family, had not
escaped insult from Alessandro’s companions:
he himself, it was thought, had singled out,
as another victim, this noble lady, who shortly
after died poisoned. It was in the father’s
palace that the discontented assembled nightly.</p>

<p class='c010' >Lorenzo, named, from his slight figure and
delicate features, Lorenzino, belonged to the
legitimate branch of the Medici and the republican
party of Florence. He was a poet,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_296' id='Page_296'>296</a></span>
and had written works which ranked among
the best of his time,—but still more a politician;
and devoted to the study of antiquity,
his admiration centered on those who had
freed their country from a tyrant; and resolved
to imitate them he confided his intentions
to none, resting on the strength of his
single arm.</p>

<p class='c010' >To become more surely the intimate and
friend of Alessandro, he plunged into all kinds
of dissipation with more ardour than himself.
The young student, with his pale features and
melancholy habits, became the minister of the
duke’s pleasures, and day and night his companion;
till Alessandro, the most suspicious
of princes, placed in the traitor who dogged
his steps a confidence so boundless, that he
replied to one who, noticing the strange change
in his flatterer’s character, bade him beware:
“If I were obliged to leave Florence, I would
confide the care of mine interests to Lorenzino.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Near the houses of the duke and his confidant,
lived a fair lady, the wife of Leonardo
Ginori, who as yet had evaded stratagems
and resisted bribes. Alessandro confided his
love to Lorenzino, and said that his last hope
rested on him; and Lorenzino promised to
serve him, and assured him of success.</p>

<p class='c010' >Some time before, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Benvenuto Cellini</span>, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_297' id='Page_297'>297</a></span>
himself tells the circumstance, had asked an
audience of the duke, to show the coin on
which, by his order, he had engraved his portrait,
and ask leave to finish his work in Rome.</p>

<p class='c010' >The reverse of the medal was yet undesigned,
and the duke, unwilling his artist
should depart, desired Lorenzino (present as
usual) would advise him to stay. The young
man obeyed; and Benvenuto, having argued
for the necessity of his repairing to Rome,
where his workshop was, suddenly turning to
the favourite, added, “And you, my lord, who
are both learned and witty, will you not
supply a reverse for this coin?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I was at that moment,” said Lorenzino
gravely, “thinking of such a one as might be
worthy of his excellency.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The duke said, smiling, “Give it him,
Lorenzo, and he will remain.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I will,” replied the favourite, with a
sarcastic expression of countenance; “as soon
as to do so lies in my power, and I hope it
will astonish the world.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Alessandro laughed, and Benvenuto departed.</p>

<hr class='c002' />

<p class='c010' >The 6th of January, 1537, Lorenzino informed
the duke, that Caterina Ginori had
promised to meet him that night, but not at
the palace. She had chosen for greater
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_298' id='Page_298'>298</a></span>
secresy the favourite’s house, to which a private
passage, constructed by Alessandro’s command,
led from the ducal residence. Masked,
and holding his sword in his hand, but not
having beneath his cloak the cuirass which he
constantly wore by day to protect him from
his suspected Florentines, the duke arrived at
the place of rendezvous; and Lorenzino quitting
him to seek the lady, he stretched himself
on a couch to await his return—his weapon laid
on his pillow, but the sword knot so twisted
by Lorenzino’s hand, that to draw it forth was
impossible. The assassin lingered some time:
he had placed as watch on the duke a man in
whom he could confide, named Scoroucoucolo;
and he staid to prepare him for a murder
without revealing who was to be the victim.
Returning softly to the chamber, they saw
that the duke slept, and Lorenzino, profiting
by the opportunity, plunged his sword in his
body. The duke sprang up notwithstanding,
and, seizing a footstool for shield against his
enemy, rushed towards the door, but Scoroucoucolo
struck him with his knife on the cheek,
and Alessandro, dropping the footstool, sprang
furiously not on him, but on Lorenzino. “Traitor,”
he shouted, and these were the sole words
he spoke, “traitor, I did not expect this from
thee.” Lorenzino, weak of body, inferior in
strength to his antagonist, even though
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_299' id='Page_299'>299</a></span>
wounded, by a violent effort forced him back
upon the couch, and held his hand on his
mouth to stifle his cries, but he felt the impossibility
of ending his fearful work alone; and
while Alessandro in his struggles bit his thumb
so violently as almost to sever it from his hand,
he called to Scoroucoucolo for aid, and the
bravo cut the duke’s throat, while Lorenzino
exerted his last strength in holding him down;
but, recognising him when the deed was done,
he had well nigh fallen from fear. He followed
Lorenzino, who fled first to Bologna, and then
to Venice, to join Filippo Strozzi: forgetting
his interest in the republic in his private fears;
proving himself throughout a coward; and
having wandered long, evading the snares
laid for him, died at last the death he merited
by the swords of two Florentine soldiers of
Alessandro’s guard, assassins also.</p>

<p class='c010' >To-day and every day we have visited the
Galleria with its collection of statues and
paintings, which would alone make a pilgrimage
to Florence an enjoyment not to be forgotten;
but though even the enthusiasm of
guide-books could not here succeed in cooling
mine, though we offered, like the rest, our
quota of homage to the “Venus of the tribune,”
acknowledging that no copy conveyed
an idea of her perfection, and no praise
could exaggerate it; though we have lingered
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_300' id='Page_300'>300</a></span>
before the marks of the immortality of those
who have long been dust, and brought away
recollections which summon back as the loadstone
iron, you will not expect a description
of all which has been so often criticised before
both ill and well, and in either case can convey
no definite ideas on the subject. On the
splendid collection of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Palazzo> Pitti</span> the
same reasons make me silent also, for one
must write either a mere catalogue of names
or a volume, and both would weary; though it
contains the battles of Salvator Rosa and his
conspiracy of Catiline, and Guido’s Cleopatra
and the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Madonna della Seggiola</span> of Raphael,
and the Fates of Michael Angelo with their
purity of outline and coldness of colouring,
perhaps resembling the painter’s disposition and
life, and the productions of Titian and Vandyck
and Paul Veronese and others, not unworthy
of being companions of these, forming
a mass of precious things, among which
there is not one counterfeit. I found the fine
suites of rooms occupied by them, always full
of students, to whom the grand duke’s liberal
feelings afford every facility for improvement
in their art. Yesterday afternoon we passed
in the Boboli gardens, which fine old trees
and irregularity of ground render, if less
majestic, far more beautiful than those of
Versailles, which took them for model. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_301' id='Page_301'>301</a></span>
was in the year 1418, that Luca Pitti purchased
for about £230 sterling of that time,
the ground on which the palace was constructed;
destined, at the ruin of that rich and
proud family, to be sold to the Medici, but to
retain its original name, rather in token of
the downfall of the first possessors than of the
modesty of the last. Its purchaser was <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cosmo
de’ Medici,</span> son of John of the black bands,
elected duke after the murder of Alexander,
and husband of the unfortunate Eleonora of
Toledo, who died of grief for the loss of her
slaughtered sons, or, as some records assert, by
the duke’s hand also. Cosmo united in his
person qualities the most opposite, patient as
a botanist in the Boboli gardens which himself
had planted; a laborious chemist, methodical
even to minutiæ in the sciences which were
his amusement; calm as persevering, yet a
man of terrible and uncontrolled passions, who
assassinated a nobleman in his own halls and
with his own hand, and, in the four first years
of his reign, condemned to death by default
four hundred and thirty emigrants, placing
a price on the heads of five and thirty. In
1562, during the hunting season, he had gone
to enjoy this amusement, which, notwithstanding
his severe and sombre disposition, he preferred,
to the castle of Rosignano in the
Maremma, an unhealthy part of the state of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_302' id='Page_302'>302</a></span>
Sienna. While there, the two youths, one
aged nineteen, the other but fifteen years, died
suddenly, and their mother a day or two after.
An attempt was made to persuade the Florentines
that the pestilential air of the country,
marshy and unwholesome, had produced the
short and fatal illness which carried off three
persons in so brief a time, but it became
known that, on their return from a hunting
party, a dispute had arisen between the
brothers, at the close of which the eldest, Cardinal
John, had received a mortal blow from
the boy Don Garcia. The enraged duke
sprang upon his second son and laid him dead
at his feet; their mother was a spectator of
this scene; she might well have died of sorrow
as was averred, but many whispered that a
witness of his conduct so nearly interested,
was not to be borne by Duke Cosmo.</p>

<p class='c010' >On the death of Eleonora of Toledo, Cosmo
had attached himself to a fair young lady of
the house of Albizzi, named Eleonora also,
and with a love so excessive, that it was feared
he might marry. A person of his household
thought it well to communicate these fears to
his son, and Francesco had the temerity to
speak on the subject to his father. The old
duke’s violent temper roused, his heir had
almost fallen its sacrifice; the presence of the
informer only saved him, for Cosmo, like a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_303' id='Page_303'>303</a></span>
wild animal baffled in his first spring, rushed
on this easier prey and plunged his sword into
his bosom. It was Cosmo, who having been
crowned grand duke in St. Peter’s at Rome,
returned to his <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Palazzo Pitti,</span> to marry there
the poor and beautiful Camilla Martelli, who
replaced in his affections the second Eleonora,
and Francis, in whose favour he had abdicated,
dared make no further observation, since he
himself, though husband of the austere and
pious arch-duchess Jane, was the lover of
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Bianca Capello</span>. Well known as is the latter’s
romantic story, its place is here recalled by
the walls in which she was the light love and
the regal mistress; and the palace court
where was held the joust in her honour, in
which Duke Francis broke a lance.</p>

<p class='c010' >Two years before his marriage with Jane of
Austria, a fugitive pair arrived in Florence;
Bianca, daughter of the noble house of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Capello</span>,
and Pietro Bonaventuri, clerk in the
bank of Salviati at Venice. Proximity of
residence caused their meeting frequently,
and they loved “not wisely, but too well,”
both too young to feel difference of fortunes
an obstacle. Their affection was favoured by
a menial of Bianca’s, who procured a false
key for a private entrance of the palazzo:
and while its inmates slept, the young girl
nightly left the protection of her father’s roof
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_304' id='Page_304'>304</a></span>
to visit her lover, and returned before dawn.
There occurred at last some mistake on the
part of the attendant: the door had been
barred or the key left within, or an uninterested
passenger passing along had shut it
in precaution, and Bianca, who could not enter
unobserved, or remain to confess her fault,
since she knew what vengeance must follow,
tottered back to Bonaventuri’s presence, and
they fled together.</p>

<p class='c010' >Apprised of their flight and of their marriage,
her infuriated father obtained from the
Council of Ten its sentence, condemning Bonaventuri;
and casting his uncle Baptista, innocent
of any fault, into an unwholesome
prison, where the old man was seized with
fever and died. At Florence, Bianca implored
the duke’s protection. Made curious
by the fame of her beauty, he sought an interview;
she first refused, then consented to one,—to
several,—then looked for his coming,—then
changed by degrees. Her husband was
named to a place in the household, which he
accepted; and when the marriage of Francis
was concluded, for till then the intrigue was
kept secret through policy, the most pleasant
apartment of his palace was assigned to
Bianca, and in their gratified ambition and
flattered vanity, the husband and the wife
were content to forget their early love with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_305' id='Page_305'>305</a></span>
its fondness and its sacrifices. The arch-duchess
was amiable but grave and proud,
and while her beauty was unnoticed by
Francis, of whose life hers was a continued
criticism, passed as it was in exercises of piety,
Bianca’s favour increased daily. Her wit
and gaiety became more necessary to unbend
the sombre temper and warm the
sterile imagination of Francis, and as a relaxation
from his fatigues and calculations,
as banker, trader, diamond merchant and
sovereign. On the first coming of Bonaventuri,
when the Venetian senate had offered two
thousand ducats for his life, and the family of
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Capello</span> dispatched assassins on his track, Francis
protected him for love of Bianca; but he
had grown insolent in his dishonour, and become
the admirer of a young widow of high
rank, he boasted of it so openly, that her relations
in turn complained to the duke both of his
conduct and its publicity. Francis desired
Bianca to send for and remonstrate with him;
and anxious to hear their private conversation,
placed himself where, unseen, he might witness
the interview. It fell not out as he
expected: for when the two were once more in
presence, each betraying and betrayed, and
Bianca faltered forth her message, Pietro,
whose love was not wholly extinguished, yielding
to a sudden burst of jealousy, loaded her
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_306' id='Page_306'>306</a></span>
with invective, threatened her with death;
and while Francis, hid and observing silently,
decided that the life of the violent man he had
supplanted henceforth might endanger his
own, Bianca softened, in sorrow not in anger,
wept her reply to his words of contempt and
passion; and when he had flung from her,
sought the duke to plead her husband’s cause.</p>

<p class='c010' >As Bonaventuri left the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Palazzo Pitti,</span> he
met one of those relations of the fair widow
whose remonstrances had caused his late interview
with Bianca. He held a pistol to his
throat, and said, “I know not wherefore I do
not kill thee,” cast him from his path, and
passed on. The insulted nobleman asked an
audience of the duke that very day. They
took several turns in the presence-chamber
together, in view but not in hearing of the
court, as they conversed in a very low tone.
That evening Francis left Florence for his
villa, and remained absent but two days. On
their return, Bianca was told that, waylaid by
ten persons of the widow’s family, Bonaventuri
had been murdered. If she gave a few tears
to his memory, it was the only tribute offered
it: for no search was made for the assassins,
and no punishment awarded. This was in
1572, and in —74 Cosmo died; and the first
act of Francis, having taken the title of Grand
Duke, was to enclose in a cloister, where she
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_307' id='Page_307'>307</a></span>
ended her days, his father’s widow, Camilla
Martelli. The new grand duke, of inexorable
temper, though needing himself indulgence,
by the rigour of his laws and the scandal of
his life, by trading on his own account, ruining
the state while he tripled his private
revenues, drew on him his subjects’ hatred.
His archduchess, Jane, died 1578, her pride
and affection alike trampled on, the last stroke
she received being the reception, like a triumph,
which greeted Bianca’s brother. Weary
of hearing her praises, he quitted Florence
and Bianca for a time. Even before the murder
of the latter’s husband, he had made her a
promise of marriage, and, fearing the power
of absence, she wrote eloquent letters, in some
reminding him of his word passed to her, in
others apparently resigned, but saying, that
to reconcile herself to his loss she was determined
to die. The softened duke returned and
repeated his promise. A priest, employed by
the Venetian, commanded him to marry her
on pain of the church’s anger; and on the 5th
of June, “not two months” after the death of
the archduchess Jane, so that “the funeral
baked meats might have furnished forth the
marriage table,” he espoused Bianca, their
nuptials being solemnized in the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">palazzo,</span> but
so secretly as to remain unknown even to the
grand duke’s family. The Cardinal Ferdinand,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_308' id='Page_308'>308</a></span>
his attached brother, who, having saved
him from a conspiracy got up against him
some time before, in grief at his conduct had
quitted Florence, now returned, hoping it had
changed. The grand duke was indisposed, and
tending him at his bedside sate Bianca. The
former was constrained to confess their marriage,—a
piece of news which the cardinal
received in silence, and soon quitted the apartment.
As he departed, which he did immediately,
he was observed to brush away a tear.
The term of mourning for the archduchess
passed, and the approbation of Philip the
Second obtained, the duke made public his
ties with Bianca, and celebrated them with
tournament and festival at the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Palazzo Pitti.</span>
The Venetian senate proclaimed her “Daughter
of the Republic;” the cannon thundered,
and the bells of St. Mark rang; the palaces
were illuminated; and the father and brother
of the dame, who, more pure but less fortunate,
had quitted their city beneath their ban as the
fugitive love of the low-born Bonaventuri, were
created knights, and styled “<em>most illustrious</em>,”
and took precedence of the nobles of Venice,
whose names were more ancient as well as
brighter. Bianca was crowned Grand Duchess
in the cathedral of Florence,—embassies from
her native town, and from others of Italy,
arriving to do her honour. The Cardinal
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_309' id='Page_309'>309</a></span>
Ferdinand was a solitary contrast to the vile
flatterers who crowded thither. He remained
at Rome; but his sister-in-law had resolved
that their family differences should at least be
no longer apparent to the world.</p>

<p class='c010' >Since the rupture of their friendship, Francis,
with little delicacy, had refused to pay the
revenues due to his brother, who, being generous
and prodigal, was necessarily in extreme
embarrassment. Of this Bianca was aware,
and using all her influence with Francis, she
determined him to pay not only the sums due
yearly to Ferdinand, but likewise the accumulated
arrears.</p>

<p class='c010' >Her seeming generosity won over the cardinal,
and he returned to Florence; where, as
he was a man of honour and probity, the
reconciliation was on his part sincere. The
duke, whose love had suffered no change, earnestly
desired a son by Bianca, who expressed
hopes of maternity, but so as to awaken the
suspicion of Ferdinand, who, as heir presumptive,
kept close watch on his sister-in-law’s
conduct. It is told of him, that the hour being
arrived, and he waiting in her ante-chamber,
there entered from without an attendant, bearing
a lute with apparent care, who passed
towards the grand duchess’s apartment. The
cardinal seized her arm, took from her hands
the case, and opening it, found within a new-born
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_310' id='Page_310'>310</a></span>
infant. Thenceforward sworn, though
secret foes, they yet met as before, and Ferdinand
was invited to accompany his brother and
the duchess to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Poggio,</span> their villa at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Caiano.</span>
There was served at the repast which awaited
them, a favourite dish of the cardinal, but of
which Bianca pressed him to taste so earnestly
and strangely, that he pleaded indisposition,
and ate nothing. The grand duke, on the contrary,
ignorant of the plot, and tempted by
the meat so praised, insisted on eating of it,
notwithstanding her entreaties. In despair
she did likewise, and both died of the poison.
The cardinal, for whom it had been prepared,
returned unharmed to preside at their funerals;
the bodies were carried for interment to San
Lorenzo, but with his command that Bianca’s
corpse should be so disposed of, that no trace
might remain; while, in the meantime, by his
order also, the insignia of power, worn by her,
were trodden under foot, and annihilated.</p>

<p class='c013' >Spent the afternoon again in the delightful
Boboli garden: its surface is extremely irregular,
and its eminences command fine views;
the hill, on which is built the Casino, looks
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_312' id='Page_312'>312</a></span>
down on Florence, bounded by her Appennines,
and seen hence with her domes and old towers
to best advantage. We sat a long time admiring
on the stone steps which lead to the
garden below; burning and cloudless, the day
and the sky were Italian, and being a festival,
the bells of the numerous churches were in
motion, and their music came mellowed up the
height, note below note, most enchantingly,
bringing with it a feeling of calm and soothing
more than belongs to silence.</p>

<p class='c010' >On our way to the hotel, we crossed the
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ponte Vecchio,</span> still covered with the old shops,
in one of which worked <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Benvenuto Cellini</span>. To
this bridge attaches a romantic story:—In the
year 1215, the dispute between pope and
emperor (each finding partizans among the
Florentine nobility) had scattered a powder-train,
which waited but a spark to ignite and
desolate the city. The adventure I am about
to tell served as torch to spring the mine.
The heir of the noble house of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Buondelmonte</span>
had affianced himself to a daughter of the
Amidei, noble also. He was young and very
handsome. Riding through the streets some
days after his promise made, he passed under
the windows of the Donati mansion, at
one of which stood its lady with her youthful
heiress by her side, who was surpassingly
lovely. The mother spoke to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Buondelmonte</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_313' id='Page_313'>313</a></span>
reproachfully: “You have made an unworthy
election,” she said; “the hand of this maiden
was destined for you.” Whether his first
choice had been merely one of interest, or proceeded
from an attachment rather fancied than
felt, I cannot say; but this Juliet driving forth
the memory of the Rosalind, falling in love at
first sight, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Buondelmonte</span> breathed the most
passionate vows, and, disclaiming all other
ties, swore that she only should be his bride.
As this was an offence not to be pardoned, the
Amidei family held council as to its punishment;
other nobles, friendly to them, and
indignant at their injury, being present also.
“Shall we merely dishonour him by a blow,
or shall we wound him?” was the question;
but Mosca of Lamberti said, gloomily,
“Neither, for he must die!”</p>

<p class='c010' >The morning of Easter-day, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lamberto degli
Amidei,</span> this <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Mosca de’ Lamberti</span> and others,
informed that <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Buondelmonte</span> was to make an
excursion on the opposite shore of the Arno,
waited his passage at the head of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ponte
Vecchio,</span> where at that time stood a statue of
Mars. The young man soon appeared, attired
in white robes, and mounted on a superb
courser caparisoned with white also. As he
arrived near the statue’s pedestal, they rushed
upon him, and dragged him from his horse.
Mosca Lamberti and Amidei forced him down
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_314' id='Page_314'>314</a></span>
into the dust and slaughtered him. This was the
rallying word: for the murder was hardly perpetrated,
when the whole city rose in arms, and
divided in two factions: those of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Buondelmonte’s</span>
party bearing the Guelph banner; those of
the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Uberti</span> and Amidei fighting beneath the
Ghibelline.</p>

<p class='c010' >Thus the first demonstration of their differences
of opinion rose from a private quarrel,
as through their bloody feuds in after times,
private interests and private vengeance found
a mask under the names of pope and
emperor.</p>

<p class='c010' >To Santa Croce this morning. The unfinished
façade of the church, destined to be cased in
marble, (a work which was begun and abandoned,)
closes at its extremity the Piazza
where in republican days were spectacles
given and rejoicings made. On the right of
this melancholy square is the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Palazzo Borgo,</span>
with its exterior still exhibiting the faded
frescoes, which, executed by the best artists of
the time, among the rest Giovanni di San
Giovanni, were completed in twenty-seven
days. The good drawing may be distinguished
still; the colours will soon have wholly disappeared.
The church is remarkable as containing,
besides some fine paintings, the tombs
or cenotaphs of some of the greatest of Florence.
On the right hand entering, (opposite
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_315' id='Page_315'>315</a></span>
the inscription on the column to the memory
of Francesco Neri, murdered in the cathedral
the day young Julian perished,) is the monument
to Michael Angelo, whose remains
the citizens of Rome, where he died, were
anxious to keep possession of after his death,
as they had been proud of his presence during
his life; but which Florence, loth to yield,
seized by stratagem, for the corpse of her
glorious child was transported to his birthplace
in a case destined for merchandise. He
died in 1564, the year in which Galileo was
born; the sarcophagus raised over his ashes
is surmounted by his bust, and round it weep
the figures of Sculpture, Painting and Architecture.
The monument which follows this is
by Ricci, and dedicated to Dante’s memory,
though not raised above his corpse, which
Ravenna refused to the ungrateful city. It is
a stiff assemblage of colossal figures, the best
being that of Poetry, leaning her head on the
arm which rests on the cenotaph and dropping
the wreath from her hand. Italy stands bolt
upright folded in a blanket, and with a tower
on her head, one arm stretched upward, the
other holding a sceptre, resembling the pole
of a French bed. Dante’s figure surmounts
the monument heavily and ungracefully,
and seated in an arm-chair, looking
down on the personages who weep for his loss.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_316' id='Page_316'>316</a></span>
A contrast to this is the noble tomb of Victor
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Alfieri</span>, the work of Canova. The medallion
containing his likeness is placed on the sarcophagus,
and over it stoops and weeps Italy
with the grace of a goddess, and the sorrow of
his love; it was erected at the expense of the
Countess of Albany. Opposite is the white
marble pulpit, whose compartments exhibit
the sculptured story of St. Francis, by <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Benedetto
da Maiano;</span> the small figures below are
those of Faith, Hope, Charity, Force and
Justice, and it is difficult to see anything more
beautiful. The next mausoleum is that to
the memory of Nicholas <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Machiavelli</span>, with
its fine and perhaps unmerited epitaph,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tantonomini nullum par eulogium, Machiavelli</span>”—the
extraordinary man of whom it
remains undecided, whether he wrote to corrupt
or warn; who poor, and having a family
to provide for, retired in an insignificant
village, passed his mornings in superintending
his labourers, in taking birds by the net, or in
the study of Petrarch and Dante, and his
evenings in the composition of the works
which remain to his shame or his honour.
Near the entrance door on the left hand is
the tomb of Galileo, his bust surmounting
the funereal urn, the figures of Geometry and
Astronomy standing at either side: all honour
paid to the memory of the man whose life was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_317' id='Page_317'>317</a></span>
calumniated, and whose person persecuted;
who, destined when young to the study of
medicine, followed alone, and despite his
father’s will, that of mathematics, till arrived
at the sixth book of Euclid, transported with
the utility of his beloved science, he sought
his parent, confessed his progress, and implored
him to oppose it no farther; whose
success conducted him before the tribunal of
the Inquisition to abjure there, and on his
knees, when aged seventy, the “error of his
doctrine, which affirmed the motion of the
earth, and the heresy of which he had been
guilty;” who murmured, as he arose from
a position more humiliating to his ignorant
judges than to himself, “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">E pur si muove;</span>”
and who died blind eight years after, in 1642,
the year in which Newton was born.</p>

<p class='c010' >A door beside the church, and on the Place,
opens on a corridor, paved and lined with
tombstones, forming one side of the cloister, to
which, at the extremity of this open funereal
gallery, a flight of steps leads down under
the monument elevated against the wall, the
ancient marble sarcophagus, on which lies the
figure of a bishop in his robes, while on the
side is carved the Resurrection: it is the tomb
of Gaston della Torre, head of the Guelph
faction, son of Conrad lord of Milan. The
elegant chapel with its cupola and Corinthian
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_318' id='Page_318'>318</a></span>
columns was raised by command of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pazzi</span>
family, on the design of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Brunelleschi</span>. Crossing
this cloister, with its well and cabbage
garden in the centre, I pushed open the door
of a second like itself, similar even to the
cabbage crop, but consecrated to the sole use
of the friars; for above another door, which
shuts in a staircase leading within the convent,
was inscribed in large letters, “Silenzium;”
so that fearing to disturb the invisible
brethren, we went away, and to the
church of San Lorenzo, less remarkable for
its own beauty than the tombs of its sagrestia
by Michael Angelo, and its <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cappella de’
Principi</span> separated from it by an iron grating
only; a rich homage offered to corruption.
We had already gone thither at an undue
hour, and to-day also mass was being performed,
and the crowd of Florentine poor,
whose pious filthiness one fears to approach,
kneeling over the floor. We determined on
waiting patiently, and stood, fearing to disturb
the service, quietly examining the pavement
stone, which between the high altar and the
Chapel of the Princes is the monument of
Cosmo, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pater Patriæ</span>: it bears a simple inscription,
indicating that he was so named by
a public decree, lived 75 years, and lies below.</p>

<p class='c010' >A good natured priest, who just then
crossed the church with some Italian ladies,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_319' id='Page_319'>319</a></span>
seeing we were strangers, made us a sign to
follow, which we obeyed; and notwithstanding
the just commenced ceremonial, he took the
office of cicerone, and led the way into the
new sacristy, so is called that built during
Clement the Seventh’s pontificate, and after
Michael Angelo’s designs. On the right
hand on entering is the tomb of Julian
of Medicis, duke of Nemours, the warrior
above seated in a niche, the celebrated figures
of Day and Night couched on the monument.
Opposite is the mausoleum of Lorenzo, duke
of Urbino, himself in his niche likewise; a
similar tomb below bearing the figures of
Twilight and Aurora. The face of Twilight
is unfinished. They were the nightly task of
the sculptor, when employed by day on the
fortifications of San Miniato; by a strange
contradiction in the character of an honourable
man, the first destined to retard the success of
the Medici, the last to establish their fame.
It was he who, in reply to a verse addressed to
his statue of Night, wrote the four lines of
melancholy beauty, which prove his feeling
for his country:—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c014'   >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>Grateful to me, to sleep, to be of stone.</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>Ever while sorrow and while shame shall last,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>The lack of sight and sense is happiness,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>Therefore awake me not! I pray speak low.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_320' id='Page_320'>320</a></span>
The Madonna and Child are also the work
of Michael Angelo. In this sacristy were laid
the mortal remains of the Medicean family—in
1791 transported hence to the subterranean
church. Our new friend, the old priest, led
the way to the Cappella, which is built above,
of octagon shape, with walls and pilasters of
precious marbles, ornamented with the arms
of the chief cities of the state, executed in
“<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pietre Dure</span>,” and with the perfection which
belongs to the Florentine art; lapis lazuli,
verd antique, porphyry, and mother of pearl,
and oriental alabaster, with the jaspers of
Cyprus and Sicily, for materials. Of the six
sarcophagi, constructed in Egyptian granite
and green jasper of Corsica, some bear pillows
of red jasper, which the weight of the jewelled
crowns they carry seems to have pressed down;
while in the niches over others are the gilded
bronze statues of those who lie below; that of
Cosmo by John of Bologna. The painting of
the dome is now in progress, and seems rather
gaudy than good. The priest led us thence
to the old sacristy, built before the church
itself; its architect was <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Brunelleschi</span>, and in
its centre is a mausoleum, by Donatello, to the
memory of two Medici.</p>

<p class='c010' >We took leave of our kind guide here,
going, as he had advised, to Santa Maria
Novella—famous, as its architecture was so
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_321' id='Page_321'>321</a></span>
prized by Michael Angelo. Hollowed in the
wall, which joins its façade, are niches, which
the Italians call sepulchres, and which served
for pillories to expose the condemned prisoners
of the Inquisition, when the members of its
tribunal were Dominican friars. The church
is divided into three aisles, whose arches
diminish as they recede, giving it an appearance
of extent it does not possess in reality.
In one of its chapels is an ancient picture of
the Virgin and Child, surrounded with Angels,
by Cimabue, so prized at the period of its
execution, that, having been exhibited like a
treasure to Charles of Anjou, it was borne in
procession to the place it now occupies.</p>

<p class='c010' >Having examined the monuments and
pictures, some deserving of far more attention
than is yielded in a flying visit like ours, we
passed out from the church by a door of the
left hand aisle, into a cloister once a cemetery;
for round the walls, still covered with faded
frescoes, and under our feet, were old inscriptions
and gravestones, and in the centre,
among cabbages and high grass, which partly
conceal it, an ancient tomb. The windows of
the fine chapel, which, in 1566, received the
name of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cappella degli Spagnuoli,</span> look
beneath the arches of the cloister on this desolate
view. It was ceded to the Spaniards,
then filling places at court, and occupied in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_322' id='Page_322'>322</a></span>
commerce. The workmen, employed in placing
ornaments for some festival, good-naturedly
desired we would enter to view the frescoes of
its walls. Some are by Memmi, who was the
friend of Petrarch, and among the figures of
his composition has placed him beside a knight
of Rhodes; and his fair Laura, conversing with
some seated females, and representing “The
Will”—(<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">la Volontà</span>)—is distinguished by a
small flame which burns on her breast, and a
green vest scattered over with violets.</p>

<p class='c010' >Near the portal, by which we had issued
from the church, there is an arched corridor,
leading to another cloister, now encumbered
with rubbish. Following down it a few steps,
we passed before several low portals, apparently
of underground prisons, and a curious
little chapel, hollowed in the wall, and going
to ruin; for on this side, lumber, and accumulated
filth, and a company of oxen, who were
tied to the pillars, eating hay, stopped our
further progress; and my curiosity being yet
unsatisfied, and in search of the second cloister
described by guide-books, we returned to and
quitted the church once more, and from its
entrance on the Place passed into a court,
where a comfortable looking friar in white
was watching the arrival of some casks. As
his occupation was sufficiently worldly, I
thought his presence no hindrance, and was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_323' id='Page_323'>323</a></span>
about to penetrate on forbidden ground, when
he called me back with “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Non è permesso,
signora,</span>” not uttered, however, with the due
horror of a Dominican, but laughing with all
his heart.</p>

<p class='c010' >We had still some time for sight seeing,
and therefore proceeded towards the manufacture
of “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pietre Dure</span>” at the Belli Arti, having
carried away from the Cappella an admiration
of their beauty, which made us desire to see
the work in progress. As we walked along
the street in which it stands, a gentleman
accosted us, and, looking up, we saw the good-natured
old priest again. “In all the years
he had lived in Florence,” he said, “he had
never visited the manufactory, and as our
questions concerning it had excited his curiosity,
he was going thither now;” and he offered us
his aid and company, which we gladly accepted,
and found him even more efficient as a guide
than before, and more agreeable as a companion
also, for this second meeting placed
us on the footing of old acquaintances.</p>

<p class='c010' >A workman conducted us to the laboratories,
the stores of precious stones and marbles, and
through the various rooms containing specimens
of the art, proving its progress and present
perfection; for the wreaths of fruit and flowers
imitate the cunning hand of nature so well,
with their brilliant tints and delicate shadows,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_324' id='Page_324'>324</a></span>
as to outdo painting. The composition and
grouping are due to the best artists of
Florence, and the stones so chosen as to simulate
lights and shadows. There are some fine
productions of the manufactory at the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Palazzo
Pitti,</span> but none to be compared to a table I
saw here, whose execution occupied, to the
best of my recollection, seven years. A very
small one, which I should have wished to
possess, was to be sold for five thousand
crowns—its wreath of fruit and flowers inserted
in a slab of porphyry. The grapes
were each one an amethyst; the currants
cornelian; the corn flowers lapis lazuli. The
workmen employed in filing the stones to the
necessary size and form looked pale and
weary over their work. At sixty years old
they retire pensioned. The work which,
though not the most beautiful, our friend the
abbé considered most curious from its difficulty
of execution, is the sarcophagus in porphyry,
(destined for the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cappella dei Principi,</span> and
to be placed over the remains of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Gran
Duchessa,</span>) inasmuch as the hard substance has
been wrought to as extraordinary perfection
as if it were soft alabaster. Thirty men
worked at this twelve hours a-day during five
years. We parted with regret from the abbé:
as we are to leave Florence so soon, to attempt
to cultivate his acquaintance now would be
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_325' id='Page_325'>325</a></span>
useless. I think I told you D—— has found
here letters which recall us to Paris with as
little delay as possible. We mentioned this
to the priest, and also our intention of returning
next winter; and he desired us to seek
him then at San Lorenzo, which he inhabited,
and where we should easily find him
out by asking for Padre Francesco. We
had still several hours to dispose of, and we
set forward to our daily haunt, the Galleria,
but passed on our way the old prison, and
turned into its picturesque court, with its walls
covered with carved blazonries, and its heavy,
uncovered stair leading to the upper stories.
Fronting the street, and from the dark wall of
this gloomy building, hangs the ponderous
gallows chain.</p>

<p class='c010' >Unfortunately for our visit to the museum,
there stands, on a Place near, a large church
and convent, comparatively of modern date,
as it appears to have been built in Louis the
Fourteenth’s time. Possessed with the passion
of sight-seeing, though there seemed to be
nothing curious about this, I proposed going
in for five minutes, and doing so by the
central door, we found our way to an oratory,
wherein we had certainly no right to enter. It
was clean and modern, and having walked
round it and discovered that to do so had been
time lost, I turned to leave it by the same
door, to the discontent of D——, who was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_326' id='Page_326'>326</a></span>
tired and had seated himself on a bench, but,
arrived at it, I found that we were destined to
a repose longer than might be desirable, for
we were certainly in the private chapel of the
monastery, and the monks (unconscious of
company) had barred and double locked,
silently, but securely, all manner of egress—this
and the half dozen other doors which we
tried in vain; succeeding only so far as to
arrive in a closed corridor, and at a grating
through whose bars we could contemplate a
little desolate yard of the convent, into which
nobody came. The churches of Florence are
usually closed from one to three, but how long
our imprisonment here was to last was uncertain,
and when an hour had passed we
began to think it would prove an unpleasant
sleeping chamber. Luckily for us, however,
a young pale priest came gently in from the
convent, and kneeled down to pray before the
altar, so absorbed in his devotion as not to
observe our presence during his prayer, and
very nearly to escape us when it was ended;
for as he was gliding away with downcast
eyes, I had barely time to accost him, and say,
like the starling, “I can’t get out,” whereupon
he delivered us by unlocking door after door
with his master-key, and stood watching our
retreat, in wonder as to how we got in.</p>

<p class='c010' >This evening to the Cascine—the promenade
to which the Florentines are constant as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_327' id='Page_327'>327</a></span>
the Parisians to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bois de Boulogne.</span> It
has long alleys of finer trees, and better ground
for riding than the latter, and a prospect of
the hills which rise round Florence.</p>

<p class='c010' >We crossed the light suspended bridge to
return by the opposite shore. The view back
to the city is, saving that from the Boboli
gardens, the best of Florence; and that down
the river the most picturesque of the Arno.</p>

<p class='c010' >As we passed Huband’s stables on our road
to the hôtel, I paid a visit to Fanny. The
horses are well taken care of, but the stables
confined and crowded. Fanny, who had been
left alone longer than she approved of, had
gnawed her cord asunder, and eaten up all
the oats destined for the day’s provender of
both.</p>

<p class='c010' >Our <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table d’hôte</span> party is an agreeable one.
Among the rest, I found the first day a lady
and her family whom I met at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Simplon</span>
Inn, and who told me there a story, not at all
encouraging to lonely travellers like ourselves,
of a journey which a few years back she had
made hither with her father, and during which
their carriage had been stopped by robbers
who rifled it, held loaded muskets to their
breasts, and tore from her neck the gold
chain she wore. To-day, by a strange chance,
there was seated next me a lady who, some
years ago, before we either were married, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_328' id='Page_328'>328</a></span>
had often met in Paris ball-rooms, and now
the widow of an officer who was taken prisoner
and absolutely torn in pieces at Algiers. She
is here alone with a pale child, whose extreme
cleverness and delicacy would make me tremble,
as it does her. His soul seems too near the
surface, and his hollow cough predicts that
his mother will not change her mourning.</p>

<p class='c010' >One more tale of Florentine history ere we
depart from Florence, and I tell it without
remorse, having spared you the tourist’s usual
criticism of her statues and paintings, and
description of churches. I have even passed
over that of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Palazzo Vecchio,</span> and our wanderings
therein one day, when in search of a
guide, and bidden to go whither we pleased by
the sentinel below, we mounted stair after
stair, and roamed through long suites of apartments
till chance brought us to a corridor
whose tribunes look down on the noble council
chamber, ornamented by Cosmo the First’s
order when, in 1540, he came to inhabit the
palace, and painted in oils and fresco by Vasari
and other artists. It is a pity that this fine
hall should be crooked, which it is so excessively
as to injure its effect to the most careless
eyes. Round it are fine groups and
statues by John of Bologna and Bandinelli;
among the former that by Michael Angelo,
destined for the mausoleum of Pope Julius
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_329' id='Page_329'>329</a></span>
the Second, and left unfinished when the artist
died; and among the last the statue of John
of the Black Bands, the invincible father of
Duke Cosmo, the same whose pedestal still
remains in an angle of the place of San
Lorenzo, which it was destined to occupy. I
spare you a lengthened account of this and of
the saloons of Cosmo the Ancient—of Lorenzo
the Magnificent—of John the Invincible—of
the Pontiffs Leo the Tenth and Clement the
Seventh, on whose walls are painted by Vasari
the principal events of the reigns or lives of
each. I even pass over the small chamber in
the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Torre della Vacca,</span> which was the prison
of Cosmo, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pater Patriæ</span>, when Rinaldo of
Albizzi, his rival, conspired against him,
but could not obtain his condemnation, and
whence he departed to pass a year in exile at
Venice—a short reverse, forerunner of a constant
prosperity, lasting even as it was deserved,
till he died, aged seventy-five years.</p>

<p class='c010' >The extraordinary man whose story I would
recall to you is Savonarola, who was
born at Ferrara in 1452, and who Nicolo ended his
life on the gibbet in the old piazza at Florence.
When very young he was remarkable for his
austere habits and singular character. The
theological works of St. Thomas of Acquin
were his habitual study, and one which he
seldom quitted, save for poetical composition,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_330' id='Page_330'>330</a></span>
a pastime of which he was passionately fond.
A vision seen or fancied by him decided his
vocation when two and twenty, though he
had before refused to take orders, not choosing,
he said, to clothe himself with ecclesiastical
dignities, and belong to the world when he
had affected to quit it. He took the habit of
Dominican and repaired to Bologna, where
his talents were soon recognised.</p>

<p class='c010' >By the advice of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pic de la Mirandole</span> he
was recalled to Florence by <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lorenzo de’
Medici,</span> and arrived there he preached publicly
against the scandalous conduct of layman
and ecclesiastic, for Alexander the Sixth at
this time occupied the papal chair, and his
example had been but too accurately followed.
A republican in principles, inflexible in his
proud independence, he gave a proof of it in
1490, when he was named prior of San Marco.
It was the custom that one so promoted
should present himself before Lorenzo, recognizing
him as chief of the republic, and
asking favour and protection. Though the
Dominicans implored, and Lorenzo demanded,
Savonarola refused this mark of condescension;
he said that God, not Lorenzo, had elected
him prior. At another period Lorenzo requested
him, through the medium of some
Florentine citizens, to forbear the announcement
of coming misfortune to Florence, where
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_331' id='Page_331'>331</a></span>
such prediction ever created troubles and
aroused the disaffected; but Savonarola, far
from obeying, foretold on the contrary, that
Lorenzo himself would shortly die. This
prophecy was verified the 9th of April, 1492;
and it is said that Lorenzo, feeling himself
dying, chose the prior for confessor, notwithstanding
the slight respect he had shown him
hitherto, and Savonarola, having heard his
penitent, on three conditions promised him
absolution: first, that he should make oath
that he was a true believer, which Lorenzo
did; secondly, that he should restitute all
which he might have acquired unfairly; he
answered he would consider of it; and lastly,
that he should restore to Florence her liberty,
and to the Florentine government its popular
form; and to this third condition Lorenzo the
Magnificent made no reply, but turned in his
bed with his back to Savonarola.</p>

<p class='c010' >After the death of Lorenzo and the exile of
Pietro his son, the prior, more and more violent
in his attacks on the church, and particularly
on its chief, the infamous Borgia,
drew down on himself the latter’s excommunication,
which however his nuncio, fearful
of entering the town, posted without the walls
at San Miniato. Savonarola despised his
censure, declared its non-validity, and published
his famous work entitled the “Triumph
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_332' id='Page_332'>332</a></span>
of Faith,” which conduct, acting on the inflammable
city, divided it into two factions, the
one for democracy and Savonarola, the other
devoted to the house and policy of the Medici.</p>

<p class='c010' >Of the two monks who defended his opinions,
and who perished beside him, the most
ardent was Domenico of Pescia, who at one
period took his place as preacher during the
days which preceded the carnival, and those
which ushered in Lent. Though less eloquent
than his master, he yet, by his energetic preaching,
persuaded his hearers to seek and sacrifice
among their possessions such as to these
ascetics seemed too worldly, and calculated to
withdraw them from a severe and religious
life. Domenico formed into regiments the
little boys of the several districts, ordering
that they should march from house to house
to make a collection for the poor, at the same
time with that for the Anathema, so he styled
the objects of luxury, or works of art, which,
according to him, lay under the curse of God.
During three days the young boys gathered
their harvest of faded gala dresses and female
ornaments, of cards, dice and musical instruments,
and on the first day of the carnival,
formed of them a pile in the shape of a pyramid
before the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Palazzo Vecchio.</span> This ceremony
completed, there being among the devoted
objects many precious manuscripts and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_333' id='Page_333'>333</a></span>
the works of Boccaccio, the children were conducted
to the cathedral where they heard
mass, and after their meal, being attired in
white garments and crowned with olive, and
bearing small red crosses in their hands, they
sought the church once more, deposed there
the money collected for the poor, and again
forming in procession, arrived on the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Piazza
del Palazzo Vecchio,</span> lisping Italian hymns;
and when the chant was ended, the four children
who headed the four troops advanced
with lighted torches and solemnly fired the
pyramid, whose flame ascended to the sound
of trumpets. The next year (1498) Savonarola
in person headed the procession, and this
time the pile was composed of objects so valuable,
marble statues and precious paintings,
and illuminated manuscripts, among the latter
one of Petrarch, that a military guard was
posted round to keep off robbers. These unusual
ceremonies exasperated the Florentine
clergy; a Franciscan at Santa Croce preached
to prove the prior’s excommunication valid;
Domenico from his pulpit loudly contradicted
him, asserting the necessity of reform in the
church, and offering himself (by submitting
to trial by fire) to prove the truth against
their adversary.</p>

<p class='c010' >The Franciscan accepted the challenge:
the 7th of April, 1498, was the day appointed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_334' id='Page_334'>334</a></span>
and the burning pile was raised opposite the
old palace. Domenico arrived wearing priestly
robes and ornaments and carrying the cross,
preceded and followed by long files of Dominicans
chanting psalms as they advanced,
Savonarola marching before them. The
Franciscans, on the contrary, approached without
pomp and in silence, headed by the lay
brother, whom Domenico’s adversary, losing
courage when the day of judgment came, had
substituted to go (in his place) through the
trial of fire. The parties in presence, a dispute
arose; the Franciscans not choosing that
Domenico should enter the flames wearing his
priestly habit, or carrying the holy sacrament,
as was the will of Savonarola. The contest
growing angry, an hour passed without ending
it, and evening closing there fell a heavy rain,
which put to flight the two champions and
disappointed the multitude assembled there
to be amused by their torture. The next day,
however, Savonarola’s enemies, who felt themselves
protected by the Florentine government,
took up arms and attacked the convent
of San Marco, in which Savonarola and his
two disciples were. The monks defended
themselves stoutly, for the attack commenced
during vespers, and not till dark did the
assailants get possession of their persons and
drag them to the public prisons. The government
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_335' id='Page_335'>335</a></span>
now took the affair into its own hands;
and Savonarola, accused of uttering prophecies
not inspired, but founded on private opinions
and interpretations of the Scriptures, and
with a view to force the convocation of a council
general, which should reform the church,
was tortured and tried by delegates of the
monster Pope Alexander, and condemned with
the two brethren to be hanged on the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Piazza
del Palazzo Vecchio,</span> now <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">del Gran Duca,</span>
their bodies burned and their ashes scattered.
The gibbet was planted opposite the palace,
in the precise place where some months before
they had held their strange carnival. Brought
thither, their firmness did not for a moment
forsake them; they looked on, while the preparations
were made, in silence; when their
bodies were consumed, their remains were
collected in a cart and flung into the Arno.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>Montecarelli.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Left Florence this morning to come hither.
The weather has been cold since our passage,
and last night the snow fell heavily.
The air is a contrast to that of the city,
whose burning sun and biting musquitoes
I am however glad to turn my back on. The
Appennines appear to less advantage beneath
the grey sky than when we crossed them in
sunshine, and the Villa Borghese more sad in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_336' id='Page_336'>336</a></span>
its desolate grandeur, and saddest of all
looked the public cemetery, where the grave-diggers
were occupied in opening the deep
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fosses</span> to which each night brings inmates: it
is a large open space, without tomb or tree,
saving the few cypress, which outside the wall
shade the priests’ melancholy dwelling.</p>

<p class='c010' >We paused to take a last look of Florence
and also of Fiesole, which on our right, as we
ascended, crowns its hill, more ancient than
Florence, and most interesting as the birthplace
of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parvenue</span> Leonora Galigai
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maréchale d’Ancre,</span> whose fate and fortunes
have been celebrated by the first writer of
France, the radiance of whose fancy has shone
over history without falsifying its colours.</p>

<p class='c010' >We saw and passed the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tre Maschere</span>,
having received unfavourable accounts of its
hosts, and returned here to our former inn
with the evergoing pump beneath our bedroom,
and the stable with fern for litter, and
horned cattle for inmates. Notwithstanding
bribes, which, like other instigators to action,
fail in Italy, our horses were neglected so
long, that in my quality of interpreter, I proceeded
to scold the inattentive groom, and so
found favour in the eyes of the master, the
two personages being comprehended in one,
and his attachment to his own, which inhabited
another stable, having made him postpone the
care of ours. Among his favourites he showed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_337' id='Page_337'>337</a></span>
me a horse from whose long white tail one lock
had been severed, the Italian said in malice,
by some person who had thus chosen to annoy
him, and whom, could he have discovered, he
would have punished with his knife. I assure
you his look and gesture were sufficiently expressive
to guard the hair of his horse’s head
henceforward. Having looked in on ours in
their uneasy sleeping chamber, in and out of
which the oxen seemed to be all night driven,
and from whose roof swung, above the dry fern,
the lamp at which all the carters our fellow
travellers came to light their pipes, proving
their reliance on the care of Providence, as
they take none themselves, the safety of these
places being a miracle, I passed an hour
walking up and down before the door, under
a moon which sailed in skies whose blue certainly
does not belong to our climates, lighting
the lone inn and chestnut trees surrounding
it, till she predicted bad weather by taking to
herself a halo.</p>

<p class='c010' >Up at candlelight and off by daybreak, with
the cold tramontana for companion, growing
so violent by degrees, that I did not feel quite
tranquil at its increase as we approached the
duke’s guardian wall, and the dense fog came
sweeping by and over us. Fanny dislikes
wind, and sometimes hesitated to advance, and
we went on silent and shivering, with hardly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_338' id='Page_338'>338</a></span>
energy to look back on the view, from this
place so beautiful, of hills and plains behind,
over which rain and mist were disputing empire.
As we advanced, the mist thickened and the
rain fell, and the waterproofs did not deserve
the name they bore, and we passed <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pietra
Mala,</span> hardly knowing it again in its changed
aspect, and seeing nothing but the peaks of
the crags rising coldly out of the fog, and
ragged herdsmen, with their drenched cattle,
and a few of the large birds of prey with grey
backs and black wings, peculiar to this region.</p>

<p class='c010' >As I was riding a few yards before D——,
a woman, who saw me pass, came rushing out
of a decent cottage, having first caught from
its cradle her baby. Not seeing the manœuvre
as D—— did, I gave her some silver, thinking
her a poor traveller with a crying infant.
They are the most clever of all beggars.</p>

<p class='c010' >At last we arrived at Filigare, and paid
four pauls for the horses, and to the satellites
of custom-house and passport office <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">buone
mani</span></i> innumerable. The smallest donations
are, however, thankfully received; they pocket
half pauls. Till within a short distance of
Lojano the rain continued to fall mercilessly.
The rude wooden crosses, which we had before
noticed here and there, hid in wild nooks or on
the brow of the precipice, and which, with the
sun shining on them, looked like emblems of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_339' id='Page_339'>339</a></span>
Quiet and Consolation, seemed now only
memorials and warnings. “Pray do those
denote the death of any one on the spot where
they stand?” I asked an Italian, thinking, as
I did so, his face and appearance perfectly
suited to a bandit. “Sicuro,” said the man.
“And did they die violently? were they murdered?”
“Possibile,” said my friend with
perfect indifference, as he walked away. The
weather cleared just so long, ere we reached
our resting-place, as left time for our horses
to dry. Drenched ourselves, we gladly took
refuge in the clean quiet apartment of the
Pellegrino, under which there is, thank heaven!
no pump. I had remained up and writing a
letter to Paris, when I was roused by a crack
and loud exclamation from D——, who had
gone to rest, but whose place of repose had
sunk suddenly under him, there being not a
single screw in the bedstead. While he once
more rose and dressed himself, I set forth along
corridors, and up one steep stair and down two:
for as the new house has been tacked on to the
old, the way is sufficiently intricate. At last,
guided by a noise like the witches’ sabbath,
I arrived at the kitchen door, and, opening
it, found myself in a place and company
which called to memory the cave in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gil Blas,</span>
there being about thirty present,—drinking,
screaming, singing, half hid in the fumes of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_340' id='Page_340'>340</a></span>
tobacco, with their wild-looking, handsome
figures, grouped round the dirty tables or
blazing hearth. As I opened the door, the
shouts and songs ceased, and, with Italian
civility, all got up and closed round to know
what I wanted; so, having desired the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">padrone</span>
to follow, I made my retreat as soon
as possible, followed by our host, who was, it
seemed, aware that his bedstead lacked all
apparatus to hold it together, but had imagined
it might last till morning.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>Oct. 20th.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Left Lojano in a fog, dense and yellow,
which concealed all objects ten yards off,—hearing,
not seeing, the approach of travellers
and waggons, and D—— hailing them for our
safety and theirs. Fanny was frightened and
vicious; the road melancholy, as oxen and
pedestrians, and now and then an English carriage,
issued from the mist close at our side,
and were swallowed in it the next moment.
It was not till we had descended some miles
that the fog diminished, and then, after exciting
many delusive hopes, showing through it the
sun like a paler moon, yielding between its
discoloured waves, peeps into the valley, and
again floating like smoke before our faces, we
fairly left it behind, issuing into blue sky and
sunshine, knowing their value from privation
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_341' id='Page_341'>341</a></span>
of them. The horses knew the pilgrims’
house, but Grizzle made a violent effort to
enter the kitchen instead of the stable. Our
amiable hostess had chosen her most pleasant
apartment, and exerted all her French talent
in cookery in the dishes she had noticed to
please us before.</p>

<p class='c010' >A moonlight night at Bologna, such as this,
is impressive in its beauty, with the light
streaming down its monastic streets, and the
deep shadow of its pillared arcades. Miss
Adelaide Kemble, who is also lodged at La
Pace with her father, sang in her apartments
till a crowd, collected beneath her windows,
silenced her with its bravas. The Italians
will not believe her to be English, and her
appearance justifies their opinion, as she has
the dark eyes of their country, with features
in the style of those of Mrs. Siddons.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>21st.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >To Modena: a burning day. Arrived there
and my dress changed, I requested the landlady’s
pretty daughter to be my guide, as it
was advisable to strive to obtain some news of
our baggage, so long missing, that we begin to
be resigned to its loss and to travelling with
little beside the linen our horses carry. Having
discovered, with some difficulty, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_342' id='Page_342'>342</a></span>
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">spedizioniere,</span> who is the correspondent of our
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Commissionnaire de Roulage,</span> I found that our
trunks, having followed ourselves across the
broken <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Simplon</span> on mules’ backs, have now
been stopped by torrents likely to impede our
passage also. Modena is a miniature of a fine
city, with a handsome ducal palace and pretty
gardens, an <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Accademmia delle Belle Arti,</span> and
other public buildings. The palace is large
and handsome; the favourite apartments of
the duchess, who is very pious, communicating
with the convent, and opening on a private
corridor, by which she can reach the adjacent
church unobserved. The tribune she occupies
is so arranged as almost to conceal her presence,
glazed and heavily barred like a convent
grate. The duke’s theatre (for he is extremely
fond of theatricals) joins another part of the
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Palazzo</span>, and his splendid stables are opposite
and on the garden side. My guide said it was
one of the sights of Modena, and as she insisted
on entering, and the sentinel made room
to let us pass, in we went. It is a fine building,
with arched and groined roof, the horses
ranged down either side, all of the duke’s own
breed, and some of them superb animals.
The roan charger of the last duke stands
stuffed and under a glass case at the extremity.
There stood near us a personage, a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_343' id='Page_343'>343</a></span>
head groom I imagine, who, I am sure, will
preserve for a day or two a high opinion of my
sagacity.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I suppose you have a hundred horses
here,” I said to him. To which he replied,
“Cent uno!” with a look of admiring wonder
which would better have suited the word
Miracolo!</p>

<p class='c010' >The cathedral is near the inn; we could see
from our windows part of its curious façade
and its high old tower. The former somewhat
resembles that of the cathedral at Placentia,
having portico on portico, and strange beasts for
supporters. Its interior is more striking: flights
of steps lead up to the elevated choir, others
conduct to the half subterranean church below,
where, among numberless light pillars with
strange capitals, is the tomb of St. Geminiano,
the patron saint of Modena. The monument
of the last duke is on the left hand of the choir,
and handsome; and in the body of the church
are various altar-pieces of carved wood and
marble, covered with saints and madonnas,
deserving more attention than I had time to
pay.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>22nd.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >To Parma; oppressively warm. Bought
some grapes of a boy, who, when we had paid
him what he asked, four times their value,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_344' id='Page_344'>344</a></span>
demanded <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">buona mano.</span> Suffered much from
the heat, though we started early: for, having
given orders that our horses should not, according
to custom, be driven to drink in the cold
yard at daybreak, the hostler disobeyed, and
Fanny informed us of their delinquency by
screaming her shrill neigh till she woke us,
and D—— proceeded to restore her to her
stall, and I to prepare for our journey. Passed
again the dark old fortress of Rubiera, and
fed our horses before reaching <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Reggio.</span> We
would gladly have found refreshment for ourselves,
but it was out of the question, the
stable being the cleanest part of the premises.
Bad as was La Paone at Parma, we returned
there on account of our horses; but Parma
being intricate in its wanderings, we were
puzzled to find it. Fanny’s sagacity did not
fail even here; she led the way to the alley in
which it stands, and walked straight into the
inn yard.</p>

<p class='c010' >We went out this beautiful evening to buy
whips at the shop of the most civil of all saddlers,
nearly opposite the Posta, now the best
inn. As I passed a bookseller’s shop, I saw in
the window a pamphlet, containing the lives
of the five saints canonized in the month of
May of this year, 1839, and the ceremonies
which took place at Rome. As they were often
the subject of conversation during our stay at
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_345' id='Page_345'>345</a></span>
Florence, I stopped and bought it, and spent
an hour in its study, in this most desolate of
all uncurtained chambers.</p>

<p class='c010' >The five saints were named—</p>
<p class='c012' ><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sant’ Alfonso Maria de’ Liguori,</span></p>

by his mother to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Francesco di Girolamo,</span>
who predicted that her son deserved more than
common care, being destined to become a
bishop, to perform for the good of the church
great and marvellous things, and to live to the
age of ninety years. It seems he was a wondrous
child; and when he grew to man’s estate,
considering studies and fatigues, and maladies,
to which he was subject, insufficient to mortify
the flesh, he added thereto flagellation,
wounds, chains, and hunger: “So that,” the
pamphlet says, “the Lord God, being pleased
with this self-devoted victim, who offered himself
up an incessant sacrifice to divine glory,
chose to render him illustrious by gratuitous
gifts of prophecy, of insight into the human
heart, of being present in <em>two places at a time</em>,
and of the working of frequent miracles.”</p>

<p class='c010' ><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Francesco di Gironimo</span> was born in 1642,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_346' id='Page_346'>346</a></span>
and of him and his impressive preaching his
chronicler says, “To all this greater credit
was given, on account of the appearance of St.
Francis, bodily, in divers places at the same
time; of the power he had of curing the sick;
of his multiplying victuals miraculously, and
(last and greatest) on account of the speech of
an infamous woman, whose soul having been,
suddenly and still impenitent, borne to the
divine presence, was interrogated by the saint,
who said ‘Where art thou?’ to which she
replied, ‘I am in hell!’”</p>

<p class='c010' ><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Giovanni Giuseppe</span> was, like the other
two, of noble blood, born in 1654. It is said,
that eminent in the practice of all virtues, but
most particularly of that of humility, during
sixty-four years he wore on his bare skin a
single tunic, so joined and pieced, that from it
he received the nickname of Father Hundred
Patches, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Padre Cento Pezze.</span> He wore beneath
it an iron cross, garnished with sharp
nails. At last, having suffered from a stroke
of apoplexy, he passed five days in quiet contemplation
before he died, at the close of
which, fixing his eyes on the image so dear to
him of the holy Virgin, and remembering, to
his great comfort, how that very Mary had
many times spoken to him, and, on one anniversary
of the Saviour’s birthday, had placed
him in his arms that he might caress him, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_347' id='Page_347'>347</a></span>
died; commencing his triumph in paradise
in the year 1734.</p>

<p class='c010' ><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Santo Pacifico da San Severino,</span> when but
four years old, was accustomed to mix ashes
with the bread of his breakfast, and to say, with
a taste of paradise (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">gusto di Paradiso</span>), that
it was good. Grown up, he passed, safe and
sound and dry-footed, over the swollen river
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Menacchia.</span> The brute creatures were submissive
to him as to Adam, yet innocent; and
the gift of working miracles was accorded to
him. He died 1790.</p>

<p class='c010' >Veronica Cappucina was born in 1660.
When a baby at the breast, though habitually
requiring much nourishment, three days of the
week she refrained from swallowing more than
a few mouthsfull of milk. When hardly six
months old, one Trinity Sunday, she sprang
from her mother’s arms to the ground, on
which she walked with a firm step; but very
little older, she admonished with grave words
a man in the market-place, being herself in
her nurse’s arms, and prevented an injustice
of which he was about to be guilty; and at
this time she enjoyed the familiarity of the
child Jesus and of the Virgin, and several
times it happened that the Holy Child visited
to console her when she wept, and days there
were in which the sainted mother consigned
the blessed Jesus to her innocent arms,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_348' id='Page_348'>348</a></span>
predicting her spiritual union with him. When
she grew up, she was now inclosed in prison,
now suffered under accusation of practising
magic arts; but the only sorrow which cast her
down was the feeling abandoned by her celestial
Spouse when he failed to comfort her, as
was his wont, and this tormented her more bitterly
than the worst adversity, and forced her
to utter <em>loving complaints</em>. She died 1727.

<p class='c009' >Our morning perambulations commenced
inauspiciously, for the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">spedizioniere,</span> to whom
here also it was necessary to apply, to order
back our luggage, was in bed, and we went
thence to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Steccata</span>. Its choir is now under
repair. Curtained from curious eyes, there
are here paintings from the hand of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Correggio</span>
and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Carracci</span>; the frescoes of the fine
dome so faded as to renew a regret for the
wasting of genius on an art so perishable. I
noticed two vessels for holy water, remarkable
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_350' id='Page_350'>350</a></span>
for their execution; in the centre of each
stands a small and beautiful figure, like the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bénitier itself,</span> in white marble; one being
that of the Redeemer, the other, I think, of
John the Baptist.</p>

<p class='c010' >A priest conducted us to the subterranean
chapel below, which contains the tombs of the
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Farnese</span>. He raised his torch to show that
on the most ancient of these (I think that of
Alessandro) lay, harmless and rusting, the
sword which had been grasped by the mouldering
hand below.</p>

<p class='c010' >We went thence to visit the ancient <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Teatro
Farnese</span>, which joins the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Accademmia delle
Belli Arti,</span> and entered it, having ascended
two flights of the wide stair. In the time of
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Alessandro Farnese</span>, it was an armoury, and
by him, or by <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ranuccio</span>, his son, on the occasion
of a daughter’s marriage, transformed
into a theatre, of which it is the very <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau
idéal.</span> The centre, lined with lead, which the
French, when they came hither, took up for
shot, was changed at will to a lake, the pit,
which in amphitheatre surrounds it, and the
boxes above, would contain nine thousand
spectators: the stage, to which steps ascend,
being far smaller in its opening than the
width of the building, the whole audience
could see perfectly. On either side of the
proscenium, placed high on their chargers, are
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_351' id='Page_351'>351</a></span>
the statues of the two <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Farnese</span>, originally
only plaster, covering a wooden framework,
and now crumbling away. The front of each
box being a high open arch, shut in by a
gilded chain only, the effect must have been
brilliant when they were crowded with gorgeously
dressed courtiers and ladies. Some
of these chains are still suspended from arch
to arch, dark and rusty. The ceiling was
painted wood, representing historical subjects,
and of this but a portion remains here and
there, hanging ominously over the heads of
the curious. Napoleon, when at Parma,
unfortunately did not see this theatre, (so said
our guide,) and it was left to decay during
eighteen years—a fault which, as it was built
wholly of wood, could not afterwards be
repaired.</p>

<p class='c010' >There are doors on either side of that
opening into this theatre; on the right conducting
to the ducal library, on the left to the
picture gallery, which was a theatre likewise,
and transformed to a museum by the Arch-duchess
Maria Louisa, whose splendid bust
by Canova occupies the further end, which a
visitor, with but an hour to spare, should seek
at once; for there, on the right hand, is the
St. Jeronimo, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Correggio’s</span> masterpiece, of
which Sir Thomas Lawrence said, it might be
studied, never copied. Three times, during
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_352' id='Page_352'>352</a></span>
the day he spent at Parma, he returned to
the contemplation of this picture; and truly
painting never produced its superior, scarcely
its rival. The Holy Child sits in his mother’s
lap, with an angel beside him, who smiles as
he exhibits to the Magdalen the page on
which her sins were inscribed, now white as
snow, and the Magdalen kisses the Saviour’s
foot, and looks still repentant but consoled.
St. Jeronimo occupies the foreground, a noble
old figure, the limbs in such relief that he
seems to stand forth from the canvass, yet
still with the softness of flesh, and the “modesty
of nature.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The picture opposite this, of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Madonna
alla Scodella,</span> is a beautiful, though less perfect,
picture, by <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Correggio</span> also, as is the
Descent from the Cross by its side, which was
painted when he was but nineteen. The face
of the Saviour appears small, and wants
expression, as the attitude lacks dignity; but
the Virgin, fainting from her excess of agony,
is perfect. There are other good paintings
by various masters, though all inferior to the
St. Jeronimo. You will notice also two <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">alti
relievi</span> of the thirteenth century, found in a
convent some miles off. They are in pure
white marble, the small figures exquisitely
carved. The subject of the last and most
remarkable is the Birth of Christ. He sits
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_353' id='Page_353'>353</a></span>
below on his mother’s knee, surrounded by
figures in adoration, their heads off, alas! for
the French were lodged one night in the convent.
Above this group, and supposed to be
between earth and heaven, is a cluster of
flying angels, who mark the middle region.
In heaven sits the Almighty, receiving from a
kneeling female the infant she offers; and up
to him are riding by a zigzag road, which
commences at the bottom of the composition,
the happy souls of the elect, on horseback,
and in the costume of the thirteenth century!</p>

<p class='c010' >We rode on, the short stage to Borgo, where
the hostess and one-eyed waiter came running
to meet us, wondering at the prompt return,
which we so little expected when we passed.
They tell us the Po has done awful damage,
having swept away during the night the crazy
bridge of boats, over which, as I told you, we
rode doubtfully, sweeping from the meadows
it rushed over, cottages, men, and cattle, of
whom it is unknown how many perished. The
bodies of a young soldier and old priest were
picked up not far from the city; and floating
on the surface of the wild water was discovered,
the morning after the disaster, one
of the wooden cradles of the country, and,
being taken up by a boatman, there was
found within an infant of a month old, asleep.
Where might be its parents—or what was its
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_354' id='Page_354'>354</a></span>
name—there was none to tell; it was conjectured
that it belonged to one of those wretched
dwellings, or rather inhabited recesses serving
for such, which we noticed when we passed the
bridge, and that the same torrent which burst
its father’s door, and stifled its mother’s cry,
floated it forth in its tiny ark unharmed. They
tell me the rain has fallen ever since we quitted
Borgo, and it falls now with a violence which
I trust may cease ere morning.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>24th.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Left Borgo early. The rain had become
mist, and the mist cleared by degrees, and we
have sun and flies, though the air is not stifling
as heretofore. The passport receiver at the
gate remembered our riding through before,
and asked many questions as to our movements,
in a fit of curiosity which I gratified;
and he wished me good-bye, saying, “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">A rivederla,
signora, fra qualche anno.</span>” Again at
St. Marco.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>25th.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Started late from Piacenza, taking our host’s
word for the stage’s being a short one. We
crossed, at no great distance from the city,
Maria Louisa’s splendid bridge of twenty-two
arches over the Trebbia, which at this moment
is a narrow stream in the midst of a wide
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_355' id='Page_355'>355</a></span>
stony desert. The receiver of the twenty-four
centesimi said we had but thirty miles to ride,
but this is little consolation in a country where
to teach the meaning of distance seems
impossible; each person we met giving a
different account thereof, and after the first
hour increasing instead of diminishing the
number.</p>

<p class='c010' >At a most dirty country inn we stopped to
feed the horses. No oats were to be had, and
we paid for bran as if it had been some scarce
known rarity. We gave the hostler the sum
demanded, desiring him to pay his master the
fair price, and take the remainder for <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">buona mano;</span>
an order to which he grinned assent,
and I had the satisfaction to see the dispute
commenced as we rode away. A large building
at which we arrived soon after, was the Sardinian
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douane,</span> and the frontier passed, the
country grows interesting, and is backed by
wooded hills, an improvement on Maria
Louisa’s treeless plains; but the roads and
broken pavement of the wretched villages
through which we passed are a disgrace to his
majesty. The latter, with their mud cabins,
and casements not glazed but papered, and
their inhabitants squalid and half clothed, reminded
us of their prototypes in Ireland.
Though the morning had been cold and foggy,
the sunshine, which succeeded, was painfully
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_356' id='Page_356'>356</a></span>
burning, as in August. We had lingered on
the way, believing the distance inconsiderable,
but the sun set in a heavy bank of clouds, predicting
bad weather for to-morrow, and the
twilight yielded to darkness, so total, and unrelieved
even by a star, that D—— dismounted
and led his horse before Fanny, as the road
was bad beyond description, and we were glad
to keep to the path by its side. I do not like
riding in the dark in Italy. The character of
the country is, in the first place, hardly so good
as to render it desirable, and its waggoners all
travel without light, and straggling from one
side to the other of roads which have a ditch
on each. With all our precautions we had
nearly made unpleasant blunders, for not far
from our destination, a new portion of road,
lately made to improve the approach to the
town, but not yet completed, is closed by a
high bank of loose stones on which we had
almost ridden. Saved from this mistake, we
failed to see the Po till arrived on the very
edge of the high bank which hangs over its
water; and the horses, rather than our eyesight,
guided us to the long, narrow and crooked
bridge which crosses it, and on which we fortunately
met neither cart nor traveller. This
passed, Fanny quickened her step, for we saw the
lights of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Voghera</span> through the trees, and soon
arrived at its entrance, but rode the whole
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_357' id='Page_357'>357</a></span>
length of the nasty town to arrive at the Moro.
The horses found a quiet stable after their
forty mile journey, for the mile of Piedmont
reckons as two of Italy. We ourselves were
weary, and glad to see our dinner served in
the enormous hall, which, but for the frescoes
daubed on its walls, resembled a barn in dirt
and desolation, and to lie down in the sleeping
chamber which was, they said, the only one
remaining unoccupied, and in which the iron
bedsteads, a deal table, and wicker chair, were
the sole articles of furniture.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>26th.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Pouring rain all this day—one of the longest
I have passed, for we staid at the Moro to rest
the horses.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>27th.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Left early. The morning cold as December,
but the sun, when it appeared at last,
burning once more. To the left and behind
us, the broad plains were bounded by the distant
Appennines; and away on the right, beyond
nearer and picturesque hills, we could
distinguish a snow mountain once more. A
peasant said it was <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Cenis</span>; it was at
least one of the range, and we were glad to
see it on our horizon.</p>

<p class='c010' >The road skirts <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tortona</span>, having passed a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_358' id='Page_358'>358</a></span>
half dried river, a shrunken stream creeping
along the centre of its wide winter bed. A
high crag commands the town, having on its
summit the ruins of the fortress constructed
by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span> the Third, and which the French
blew up in 1796—the eminence, like the
plain it stands on, bare of wood, and devoid of
beauty. An idler, as we rode by, told us we
might, without much increasing the distance,
traverse the “città,” and seemed surprised that
we should choose to avoid its broken pavement
and bad air. Arrived on the plain of St.
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuliano,</span> the village
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marengo</span> was on our right,
interesting from its situation as well as
its history, for, excepting the two or three
houses built by the road side, the habitations
straggle back over the rich meadows where they
stand picturesquely grouped with green trees
and a grey tower, between and above which
rises a wooded hill, with a white church
shining on it. To the left stretched the plain;
before us were a few fine sycomores and a
bridge, traversing a brighter and narrower
river which winds between fringed shores.
From one of these houses is hung for sign a
cannon-ball, reminding us of Desaix, the
gallant young general who returned hither
from Egypt to die, having first, with his four
thousand infantry, altered the fate of the battle
almost lost by Lannes and Victor, and after
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_359' id='Page_359'>359</a></span>
his fall destined to become desperate once
more, and be wondrously won by Kellerman’s
charge with five hundred horse; for this handful
of men was during an entire hour master of
the field of battle, the infantry of both armies
being scattered and flying, and the French
not rallied till the expiration of that time.
Alessandria is close to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marengo</span>, its trees and
fortifications looking to advantage as they rise
from the perfect flat of the plain. Went to
the Albergo d’Italia, a really good inn, with a
most civil master.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>28th October.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Up by candlelight to start with dawn, which
shines not till seven: for, though the mornings
have become painfully cold, the mid-day sun is
scarcely bearable. Leaving the hotel and
asking the way of several people, who all said
“Straight on,” we proceeded straight, as
desired, and issued from the town on a high
road, which we found in the dreadful state
of all which traverse Piedmont; but having
proceeded some way, we thought proper
(the direction being wholly different from
that we have lately followed) to ask whither
it led, and were answered “Savona;” so
turned back, the equanimity of our tempers
disturbed. Perhaps from this cause I thought
more brutal than he was in reality, a driver of
calves, who was before me with his charge on
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_360' id='Page_360'>360</a></span>
the side of the road which I had chosen as
least heavy for Fanny, the mud in the centre
being three feet thick, and who desired me to
proceed thither and get out of his way, swearing
in no gentle guise. Approving of the
order neither in matter nor manner, we passed
by, scattering his herd, and left him uttering
still direr oaths, and floundering about in the
deep pools to collect the stragglers. Travelling
back over bad pavement and through
the town, we had lost an hour ere we arrived
at the fine citadel, round which the road
winds, crossing an ancient covered bridge,
through whose open arches the wind blew
almost strongly enough to lift me from
my saddle. A company of convicts, chained
together, were busy sweeping; they looked
hardened and wretched. An hour after we
met a fresh detachment, tied with cords in
carts, and strongly guarded. We had a cold
fog for comrade, and the Tanaro has overflowed
the country, saddening its whole face,
ruining crops and meadows. Near Asti it
improves, as it swells in hillocks and sinks in
dells: the former covered by the vine which
produces the famed Asti wine, but not trained,
as in Lombardy, over tall trees; and wearing a
wintry aspect ere winter has come, from the
custom of plucking its leaves to feed the
cattle. Met Capt. K—— with his family; the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_361' id='Page_361'>361</a></span>
pretty white Arab led behind the carriage.
They crossed the mountain a few days since
in beautiful weather, and this good news hurried
us onward. The people of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Albergo
Reale</span> had treated them ill; yet outside it makes
fairer show than the Leon d’Oro, whither, at
their recommendation, we went. Here, as at
Alessandria, the doors and windows of our
apartments open on the cold gallery which
runs round the inner court: bad dinner and
bad attendance, and an unpleasant landlord.
This morning, when we wished to leave early,
the stableman had lost Grizzle’s bridle, and
two hours were wasted in its search, the fairest
of the day: for, when we had ridden down
the avenue just outside the town, the drizzling
mist changed to torrents, which continued to
fall without cessation till we arrived. We
were to stop at the Angelo, but had forgotten
the name of the bourg he protected, twelve
Piedmontese miles (about four-and-twenty
English) from Asti; and the questions we made
remained almost always unanswered, the Piedmontese
dialect solely being spoken by the
peasantry. At last, in the pouring rain, up
came a waggoner, and told us Poirino and the
Angelo were about three miles farther. We
would willingly have hastened our horses, but
it was impossible: for the roads are either two
feet deep in mud or newly repaired with beds
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_362' id='Page_362'>362</a></span>
of loose stones, into which they sank to the
fetlock. Here and there the path by their
side was in better order, and we adopted it;
and D—— justly observed, that but for his
Sardinian majesty’s footpaths, horse-travelling
in his dominions would be impossible. When it
seemed the three weary miles must have been
long passed over, and still nothing was to be seen
in the most desolate plain, save the broad wet
road stretching before, and behind us, a few
trees and a spire, we again accosted a peasant
and inquired for Poirino. “It is a good bit
farther,” said the man, “and the inn is not in
the town, which you must traverse, and turn
first to the right and next to the left, and then
ride straight on, as it stands in the country.”
I presume this intelligence, which at the time
made us despair, was given in a mischievous
spirit, though the weather and our plight
should have excited compassion: for we
shortly arrived at Poirino, and inquiring for
the Angelo, some replying “Straight on,”
and some not at all, we made our way through
the filthy town to the filthier yard. Our poor
horses under cover, D——, who followed them
into the warm stable, was better off than I.
I made my way to the kitchen door, which
I found full of vetturini, this being their
dinner hour, and the place where they dine.
Received with more curiosity than civility, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_363' id='Page_363'>363</a></span>
called to mine hostess, who was busy cooking,
and desired she would conduct me to a room.
Without turning her head, she begged me to
walk up stairs, which I did, and found myself
in the before-mentioned open gallery, and,
from the voices which proceeded from the
various chambers, knew they were all occupied.
Having stood there some minutes, dripping
and shivering, looking down into the yard at
the rain plashing on the stones and the half-dozen
vetturini carriages, of whose departure
there seemed to be no chance, my gift of
patience was not so strong as to lead to further
contemplation, and I descended once
more, not this time to the door, but to the
kitchen fire, where I disturbed the lady’s culinary
pursuits, by telling her I was going to
the inn I had noticed next to hers, as I found
my presence was an inconvenience. This appeal
softened her heart: for she put down her
fryingpan and took up a key and marched
before me to open what was, in reality, her
only room unoccupied. It had a broken window
and no fireplace; but she brought me a
half cold <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chauffrette,</span> and begged I would be
patient, as I should be <i>benissimo</i> when the
carriages went on, which they would do in a
quarter of an hour; so that on my side I called
up the patience required, changed my wet
clothes, and sat (not the quarter) but a whole
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_364' id='Page_364'>364</a></span>
hour in such shivering misery as makes one expect
an inflammation of the chest next morning.
The vetturini were then in motion, and I made
my way to a fireplace just as D—— appeared
from the stables where he had seen our poor
companions provided for.</p>

<p class='c010' >After all we were served less ill than I expected,
and the dinner and beds were good.
Our hostess demanded prices which lacked
justice and modesty; but, remonstrance made,
grew reasonable. All night the rain poured,
but they told us it had done so for a month,
so that to wait might serve us nothing—the
road little better than hitherto, and the country
uninteresting till near <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Moncaglieri</span>, to
which place rain accompanied us less heavily
than yesterday, but without pause.</p>

<p class='c010' >The high hill on which it is built formed a
commanding object long before we reached it;
the route sweeps round its foot between it and
the broad Po, whose shores are here wooded
and beautiful. A person of whom we asked the
way to Turin sent us through <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Moncaglieri</span>
up the paved hill and across the town, doubling
the fatigue to our horses. We were recompensed
by passing before the old castle where
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Victor Amedée</span>, the abdicated king, was arrested,
and where he died; and also by the
fine view we obtained as we rode down the
avenue and steep hill on the other side of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_365' id='Page_365'>365</a></span>
valley and the river. Heavy clouds hid the
Alps, and the snow, lying on the hills close to
us, looked an ominous presage of what was to
succeed on the mountain.</p>

<p class='c010' >Notwithstanding the unfavourable atmosphere
through which we saw it, I prefer Turin
as a town to any I have seen in Italy. Its
situation is finer than the vaunted one of
Florence, with a broader river and more beautiful
valley, and hills more wooded surrounding
it. One of these the Superga crowns,
built in consequence of the vow made by
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Victor Amedée</span> the Second (when the troops
of Louis the Fourteenth besieged his capital)
to consecrate a temple to Our Lady, should
her aid enable him to force their troops to raise
the siege. It was whispered that the duchess
of Burgundy, whose influence was all-powerful
at the French court, had used it for her
father’s protection, and to lengthen the operations
of the French General, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Duc de la Feuillade.</span>
Prince Eugene having had time to come
up, and Turin being relieved on the day of the
nativity of the Virgin, the king accomplished
his vow. The principal <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">basso relievo</span> of the
high altar represents the deliverance of Turin
by the intercession of the Virgin; it was observed
of this Madonna that she bare a strange
resemblance to the duchess of Burgundy. A
fine bridge led us across the river to the Piazza
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_366' id='Page_366'>366</a></span>
del Pò. The arcaded streets are broad, and
the houses handsome, but mostly unfinished, to
that degree that the holes made in their walls,
for the placing of scaffoldings, remain unfilled.</p>

<p class='c010' >We went to the hotel Fœder, kept, like all
good inns in Italy, by French masters. Its
cleanliness and comfort were to us, for some
time unused to them, a very luxury.</p>

<p class='c010' >Though it continued to rain, as I had purchases
to make and a letter to put in the post
for Paris, I changed my dress and we went
out for the purpose, crossing in our wanderings
the Piazza, on whose centre stands the
old palace, built by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span> the Eighth in
1416, flanked by its four massive towers, but
in my opinion injured by the addition of
an ornamented façade of 1720. Its interior
was decorated, and its splendid staircase built,
by command of Christina, daughter of France
and duchess of Savoy. Before her time it was
said of this palace that it was a house without
a staircase, as now that it is a staircase without
a house, the former being far too grand
for the apartments to which it leads.</p>

<p class='c010' >The stables for our horses are less delightful
than the inn for ourselves, being dark, ill-kept,
and crowded. D—— bribed away a
horse of kicking reputation, whose vice Fanny
the more excited by running at him open-mouthed,
there seeming to be in her small
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_367' id='Page_367'>367</a></span>
body no room for fear. In his visits to see
them fed he nearly stumbled over a poor
fellow who lay in one of the stalls. His wife
now and then brought him drink; he was very
ill of fever his fellow hostlers said unconcernedly,
and to lie with clothes on and with damp
litter for bed seemed a strange remedy.</p>

<p class='c010' >Next me at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table d’hôte</span> sat an old man
with long white hair, who I found on inquiry
to be the Conte F——. We entered into conversation: he
was just arrived from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>,
and had crossed <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Cenis</span> in snow and mist,
and exclaimed when I told my intention of
doing so on horseback to-morrow. The kind
old gentleman offered me his carriage, and
when I pertinaciously refused, implored me to
accept additional cloaks; and was affectionate
and anxious as if he had been my father.</p>

<p class='c010' >We certainly start in the morning: for
that snows, having once fallen, will diminish
this season, there is little chance. The journey
to Susa would be too long a one, and we
are told we may be decently lodged at Sant’Ambrogio.</p>

<p class='c010' >Though it be a long story, yet from the interest
it casts on Turin, I will, for your sake,
insert here that of the abdication of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Victor
Amedée</span> the Second; the same king who
erected the Superga, and lies buried within its
walls. About a month previous to his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_368' id='Page_368'>368</a></span>
renunciation of his crown, he espoused secretly the
widow of the count of St. Sebastian, the object
of his early love, then fifty years of age. Victor
declared to his son his intention of abdicating;
and as he had proposed to himself for
model the Emperor Charles the Fifth, he chose
that a like ceremonial should be observed, and
his court and ministers were summoned to the
castle of Rivoli, which lies on the road to Susa
and near Turin: of the cause which assembled
them none were informed except the prince of
Piedmont and the Marquis del Borgo. In
the presence of all, the latter read the act of
abdication, the king preserving throughout
the proud and solemn demeanour which was
natural to him. He led, when it was ended,
the countess of St. Sebastian to the princess,
become queen. “My daughter,” he said, “I
present to you a lady who is about to sacrifice
herself for me; I pray you show respect to her
and her family.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Reserving to himself no more than a nobleman’s
fortune, with the countess, now marchioness
of Spino, he retired to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>.
For a time indeed, but of brief duration, the
new monarch asked his father’s counsel in all
affairs of moment, and sent his ministers to seek
it across the mountains; but he grew weary of
divided power, as did <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Victor Amedée</span> of the
idleness he had chosen, and the marchioness of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_369' id='Page_369'>369</a></span>
Spino urged him to resume the reins he had
dropped unadvisedly. He arrived at Rivoli
suddenly; but Charles Emmanuel, who had
been absent also, informed of his movements,
at the same time re-entered the capital, and the
old king heard with extreme annoyance the
cannon which pealed to welcome him. The
two monarchs had an interview, embarrassed
on both sides. The father spoke of the air of
Savoy as injurious to his health, and the son
commanded that the castle of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Moncaglieri</span>
should be prepared for his reception, whither
(also by his command) the court went, apparently
to do him homage; but in reality to
watch and report his actions. It was noticed
that the manners of the marchioness had
altered; that when she visited the queen she
occupied an arm-chair, similar to hers; and
at last, the moment for action come, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Victor
Amedée</span> demanded of the Marquis del Borgo
the act of his abdication, desiring him to make
known his intention of wearing again the crown
he had laid aside. The minister hesitated to
reply; the old king insisted on his obedience
within twelve hours, and this, fearing to excite
Victor’s fury, he promised and departed. The
king remained in agitation of mind, half
repenting his confidence in del Borgo; till,
when the clocks had tolled midnight, taking
a sudden resolution, he mounted his horse and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_370' id='Page_370'>370</a></span>
followed but by one servant, sought the citadel
and summoned the governor to open the gates
to him. He was refused, and returned in disappointment
to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Moncaglieri</span>. Meanwhile the
council assembled on the information of the
minister, and the arrest of the father was signed
by the son, whose hand, it is said, shook so
violently, that the secretary of state was
obliged to support it. The marquis of Ormea,
preceded by a company of grenadiers, arrived
at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Moncaglieri</span>, whose walls other troops had
already surrounded, conducted thither without
knowing whither they were going or wherefore.
The king slept profoundly in the chamber
with the marchioness, and the noise made
as they ascended the grand staircase, seizing
on the person of an attendant, who lay in the
ante-chamber, and bursting open the doors,
did not wake him. The marchioness, startled
from her slumbers, sprang from her bed and
towards a private door, hoping to escape. She
was arrested and placed in a carriage, which,
escorted by fifty dragoons, took at a gallop the
road to the fortress of Ceva in Piedmont. Not
even her cries, as she was forced away, could
wake the king, who was of apoplectic habit,
and whose sleep was like a lethargy. One seized
his sword which lay on the table, and the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comte de la Perouse,</span> drawing his curtains
back, at last roused him, and showed the order
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_371' id='Page_371'>371</a></span>
of which he was “bearer from the king.”
“What mean you by <em>the king</em>?” exclaimed
Victor; “dare you to recognise another than
me, who am your sovereign and your master?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You were so, sire,” replied <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Perouse,</span>
“till yourself commanded that our obedience
should be transferred to King Charles; we,
therefore, pray you to give us the example of
obedience now.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The old man, furious, refused to rise, and
gave a blow to the chevalier of Salace, who
approached too near his bed. He was lifted
perforce from it, and, partly dressed and enveloped
in blankets, carried rather than led
to the carriage, which waited in the court.
As he crossed the ante-chamber he seemed surprised
to see there his grenadiers; and the men
and their officers, astonished in turn, murmured,
“It is the king; why should he be a
prisoner? what has our old master done?”</p>

<p class='c010' >The Count of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Perouse,</span> fearing mutiny,
exclaimed, “In the king’s name and on pain
of death, silence!” and hurried the old monarch
on.</p>

<p class='c010' >In the court-yard stood ranged a regiment
of dragoons, which had distinguished itself
under his own eye, and which he had always
favoured. Their presence affected him, and
he stepped forward to speak; but a sign was
made to the drummers, who covered his voice,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_372' id='Page_372'>372</a></span>
and those who stood round forced him to enter
the carriage. On leaving <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Moncaglieri</span> he had
made three demands—for his wife, his papers,
and his snuff-box; but only the last was
granted. The day after his arrival at Rivoli,
iron bars and double frames were placed to
the windows of his apartments.</p>

<p class='c010' >“What are you doing?” he asked the
glazier.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I am putting up double window-frames,”
said the man, “lest you should be cold this
winter.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Why, how now, fellow,” said the king,
“do you think I shall be here this winter?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Ay, indeed,” rejoined the glazier; “this
one and many more.”</p>

<p class='c010' >After this he was, however, transferred to
the castle of La Venerie, three leagues from
Turin. The fits of fury to which he had at first
yielded, and in which it was feared he might
commit suicide, had gradually subsided into
sadness. He was, at his own demand, reconducted
to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Moncaglieri</span>, whither the marchioness
was allowed to come. He was permitted
to have books; but neither newspapers
nor anything which might satisfy his curiosity
as to events passing in the world. He never
saw his son more. He died in 1732, and his
widow sought a retreat for life in a convent at
Carignano.</p>
<div class='c008'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_373' id='Page_373'>373</a></span>
<span class='small'>31st October.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >We were up at light this morning, for the
weather had a more favourable aspect; crossed
the Piazza with its old palace, and issued from
the town on the noble avenue which makes so
fine an approach to Turin. From the plain it
crosses, the view of the Alps, covered with
snow, appearing and disappearing through
masses of clouds, was beautiful beyond most
prospects. For some time favoured with sunshine
and blue sky, we might have reached
San Ambrogio free of rain, but that Grizzle
broke a fore-shoe, and we were obliged to get
another put on at the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tre Ré</span> at Rivoli, looking
on in almost as much fear as when Fanny
dropped one at Montecarelli, on her way to
Florence. The palace which received <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Victor
Amedée</span> is on the height commanding the
town. Grizzle being shod, we thought it
better to feed both, and thus lost time; for we
were not long suffered to enjoy the country,
which grows very beautiful after Rivoli, as
rain and hail, which we had hoped were left
behind, came down in full fury on horse and
rider. The Dora, whose course we followed,
had overflowed its banks, and desolation was
here also.</p>

<p class='c010' >The valley has the character of that of
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Domo d’Ossola</span>, but it is more confined, and
has less grandeur. The rain ceased as we drew
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_374' id='Page_374'>374</a></span>
near St. Ambrogio, and the vapours were floating
up the high cliff which hangs over it, and
on whose very pinnacle stands a ruined church,
or castle, or both, a high slight tower, which
formed a most striking object as the mist
floated upwards, hiding and revealing it by
turns. As we approached the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tre Corone,</span>
its broken windows and yard choked with
manure looked so hopelessly wretched, that,
being wet through, we preferred riding on in
the expectation of getting dry, as the weather
favoured us once more. Crossing a bridge,
the straight road follows the other bank of
the river now on the left, and through a defile
of surpassing beauty. On a hill of its
own, of which it seems to be the monarch,
rising from the flat before the mountains, and
beside the river, stands a remarkable ruin.
We had passed many proud remains of baronial
castles, but this the noblest, with its
turreted walls and hollow watch-towers standing
and defying. The rain returned more
violently than ever, almost hiding Susa, which
is beautifully situated, and I fain would have
seen in sunshine, and have paid a visit to its
antiquities. Woe unto its waterspouts; they
advanced over our heads from either side of
the narrow street, irregular in their lengths,
so that to strive to avoid their contents was
vain; and drowned like mountain torrents
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_375' id='Page_375'>375</a></span>
washing what little the rain had spared. We
crossed the bridge over the wild river, and
found the Posta on the Place. I can say little
in praise of its comfort; there remained but
three rooms vacant, certainly, but I suspect
those already occupied were no better than
our own. The window shut badly, and the
door, on the open corridor, not at all, admitting
the rush of the wind and the roar of the
torrent; so that the fire scorched our faces,
while the back of our heads grew rheumatic.
The waiter was determined to do his best, for
he piled the logs till they set the chimney on
fire. He was gone when I discovered it, and
looked for a bell, but as none was there, and
I was little inclined to receive another shower
by issuing forth on the open gallery in search
of him, I watched it till it burned itself out,
which it did very safely before D—— had
come up from our travellers.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>Nov. 1st.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Up at light. A sweet mild morning, and
no rain, and our horses fresh as after a ride
in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bois de Boulogne;</span> and we decided on
going the whole way to Lanslebourg, abandoning
our first intention of sleeping on the
mountain, as the inn is ill provided, and to get
straw impossible.</p>

<p class='c010' >The Roman arch raised in honour of Tiberius
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_376' id='Page_376'>376</a></span>
is still to be seen in the governor’s garden,
built of white marble, and the Corinthian
order, and rising among broken remnants of
columns and capitals, which probably belonged
to edifices by which it was once surrounded. In
the days of Charlemagne, the famous Roland,
from whom the first Marquises of Susa boast
their descent, defended the town, signalizing
himself by most marvellous exploits; in proof
whereof there was shown some years ago a
rock, which a stroke of his sword cleft in
twain!</p>

<p class='c010' >The early part of our journey was delightful,
for the day was balmy though not bright,
and the mist shrouded the snows of the summits
before us without approaching ourselves;
and the vine, cultivated at the foot of
the mountain, stretched up its sides to the
roots of the chestnut trees, on whose green
leaves there rested but just so much snow as
bowed their branches slightly and gracefully.
As the road wound upwards we looked back
to the Piedmontese valleys, bounded by the
mountains, with their dark blue base and white
coronets; and this beauty increased as we ascended
higher and could distinguish the hill
with its ruins, and the high crag far away above
St. Ambrogio. So far the thaw had been rapid,
for no snow lay in the road here, nor till we had
passed the little inn of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Cenis</span>. At
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_377' id='Page_377'>377</a></span>
Molaret, where the church bells were tinkling
sweetly in the quiet air, the route, turning suddenly,
no longer hangs over Piedmont, but looks
on a home view, which has its charm likewise,
and the village built in the glen directly below,
among the trees of the rich meadow. The
first refuge is a little further, and by the time
we had arrived there the half-melted snow
began to ball in our horses’ feet so as to impede
our progress; and D—— having several
times dismounted to pick them, with the loss
of a quarter of an hour at each operation, we
ascertained that in this manner we should not
arrive ere dark, and began to think haste
might be necessary, as the mists, which had
hitherto held aloof, seemed thickening gradually.
To prevent an accumulation of snow,
our only resource was to trot our horses, and
the mountain being henceforth steep, it was
an unkind antidote; but Fanny shook her
head, and breasted the hill gallantly, and the
grey followed wheresoever she led.</p>

<p class='c010' >We had pursued this plan about half an
hour, when the snow suddenly fell, and its
friend the fog so closed round us that we could
see nothing but the road, and I feared that
would be invisible ere long, as I strained my
eyes to discover the precipices which might
be there, and the track which the last travellers
had left, and which the flakes effaced
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_378' id='Page_378'>378</a></span>
as they fell. From this spot the aspect of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Cenis</span> is unknown to me, almost as if I
had not traversed it; only as we crossed the
Plain of St. Nicholas, over which, but for the
hooftrack of a horse which immediately preceded
us we should have failed to find the
way, appeared for a moment the palisades of
the ascending route, seeming built on the
cloud, and a waterfall which sprang forth from
the mist to be swallowed in it again a few
yards lower. From the cliffs which skirt the
road (here rising abruptly from the level)
hung icicles from fifty to a hundred feet long,
which the mist just opened to show. I almost
thought we might be left on the mountain as
a reinforcement, for I certainly never before
knew the entire meaning of the word cold.</p>

<p class='c010' >We went on, however, patiently, and rapidly
as we could with mercy to the poor horses, who
seemed anxious to advance as ourselves. The
wind had risen, and the broad flakes of snow
in this higher region changed to small particles
of ice which drifted in our faces cold and
cutting. We passed the barrier of Piedmont,
whereon was written that a toll was to be
paid there; but we, having called and nobody
answered, went on till we reached the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grande Croix,</span> before whose humble inn stood
several waggons, and one waggoner who lifted
his hands in amazement, and said, “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Povera,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_379' id='Page_379'>379</a></span>
poverina,</span>” with an accent of pity not at that
moment misplaced, for the ice adhered to
our hats and cloaks, making them look like
an old wall from which hangs half detached
plaster; even D——’s weather whisker was
an iceberg, as were the horses’ manes and
tails. Grizzle had rubbed hers last night, and
the icicled hairs stuck forth ludicrously like
“quills from the fretful porcupine.”</p>

<p class='c010' >To stop to complain would certainly have
been to be frozen to death, and we rode fast
over the plain of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Cenis</span>, stopping to
breathe our comrades before each refuge,
as places where we could find aid, should aid
become necessary. The lake was invisible
through the mist, and we could distinguish
only the mountain rivulet which for some way
accompanied us, flowing along like a black
line through the dull white of the snow. As
we approached the Hospice, opposite which is
Napoleon’s fortification, the dark lake became
visible through the sleet, but only like a
heavier cloud lying on the edge of the plain
and recognized by its more defined outline.
Half the Hospice is occupied by monks, whose
voices reached us through the roar of the
wind, singing psalms, the other half by the
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">rcarabinieri,</span> one of whom opened the door
just sufficiently to take the passport, while a
second peeped at us through a closed and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_380' id='Page_380'>380</a></span>
barred window. I thought, considering their
situation and ours, they kept it a merciless
time, during which we walked our horses backwards
and forwards, receiving the blast on all
sides. From this level, the road ascends again,
its highest point, being I believe at the
refuge No. 20. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cantonnier,</span> who was at
work there spade in hand, desired us to be
careful and proceed at a foot’s pace, as we
had a bad portion of road before us; and we
found he was right, our horses floundering
about in deep snow a moment after. Met
here a carriage (the first); the postilion expressed
his astonishment by an oath loud and
deep. The snow-drift passed, the ground
became worse still, for it changed to smooth
ice, the wind, which every moment increased,
sweeping the loose snow from its surface.
Grizzle, who could not keep her footing,
slipped and groaned, which meant, “Get off
and lead me!” a prayer which D—— granted,
but Fanny fortunately did not make to me,
as, having felt the pain produced by cold, the
numbness now stiffened me to my saddle, and
had I been lifted from it, I should certainly
have found walking impossible. At No. 17
is the Savoy barrier, which having passed
we were called back. The good-natured Savoyard
detained us as short a time as possible,
called me “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pauvre femme!</span>” not thinking we
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_381' id='Page_381'>381</a></span>
were travelling for pleasure; and having
written down as Heaven pleased the English
names we told him, bade us speed on our way,
which we did slowly and painfully.</p>

<p class='c010' >The wind increased and threatened <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tourmente</span>.
The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cantonnier</span> had said that, notwithstanding
the quantity of snow lately fallen,
there was too little to occasion a dread of
avalanches which sometimes fall between the
refuges Nos. 23 and 24. A man walking
down the mountain four days since was frozen
to death at this spot; and at the sharp turns
of the zigzags, the blasts sweeping down the
gorge and crossing the road were so strong,
that Grizzle swayed to them, and Fanny
planted her fore-feet firmly and put down her
head to resist.</p>

<p class='c010' >Though we forbore to say so, we neither
were quite tranquil, as these gusts of wind
roared down the hollow, threatening to carry
us over the road side on the snow-drifts below,
certainly deep enough to swallow far larger
masses than ourselves and our quadrupeds.</p>

<p class='c010' >At last came a happy change from snow to
rain and from ice to mud, and we saw Lanslebourg
among fir-trees beneath, with its
pretty bridge flung over the Arc, and the inn
on the opposite side, built by Napoleon for his
staff. It was three o’clock when we arrived,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_382' id='Page_382'>382</a></span>
and we had left Susa at eight, and Fanny,
not waiting for orders, trotted into the
stable-yard. With some trouble from the
numbness which paralyzed me, I arrived in
the kitchen, where the landlady, intent on
household affairs and also on scolding a child,
having given me a seat, and desired her
servant to make me a fire above, departed
to her labours, and this was a signal for persecution,
for the spirit of curiosity was stronger
than the spirit of obedience, and she touched
my hat, and felt my habit, and walked round
me, asking questions till I was weary, and told
her that if she would first light a fire and
allow me to change my wet clothes, I would
be at her service the rest of the day.</p>

<p class='c010' >It required a great deal of smoke to drive
me from the hearth, but when she had kindled
the wood and departed, the wind which
rushed down the chimney drove the very fire
into the centre of the floor; and my eyes so
streamed from the columns which filled the
room, that I had some difficulty in finding the
way out to summon her back. She only remarked,
that it was always the case with that
chimney when it rained; and we proceeded to
another chamber on the opposite side of the
corridor, the Abigail with her flaming pine-logs
first. When installed therein, I found
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_383' id='Page_383'>383</a></span>
the air abominable: she said, “it was always
so when it blew,” so that I have passed the
afternoon burning vinegar.</p>

<p class='c010' >The snow, hail and wind have as yet
known no intermission; the bad air arrives
under the door and the icy wind in at the
window. On account of the horses, whom
eight posts like those we have travelled to-day
must necessarily have fatigued, we shall
remain to-morrow. Were the weather fair
the situation of the inn would be lovely; but
when the torrents of rain dash as now against
windows which will not close, and the wind
waves the thin muslin to and fro, and the
cold of these lantern-like rooms resists even
such fires as I have made, the inn at Lanslebourg
is the very perfection of wretchedness.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>2nd November.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Still rain and wind, but with glimpses of
pale sunshine which predict finer weather.
The bad air prevented sleep, and the blast
which sung round my head, whirling away
the flimsy curtains, bestowed a cold on my
chest, which shall not however detain me.
The horses have passed the day in the luxury
of rolling, and enjoyment of the mountain hay,
of which the pastures near this produce the
sweetest in the world.</p>
<div class='c008'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_384' id='Page_384'>384</a></span>
<span class='small'>3rd November.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Left early, for the clouds, though they
threatened, dropped no rain, and took the
road to Modane, the descent as far as Formignone
being rapid, skirting the Arc and
its pine-forests, the cold head of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Cenis</span>
towering behind. The weather grew milder
and the scenery more lovely; larch and other
trees not evergreen appearing beneath the
masses of dark fir, and red and yellow with
the tints of autumn, have a richness in their
hues I never saw equalled elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c010' >Verney, where Walpole’s dog perished, is a
beautifully situated village. The pine-forests,
which the wolves inhabited of yore, have
retreated since that time, and now clothe only
the mountain on the left, before which the
little church whose bell was tolling for mass,
and whither the country people were hastening
in their holiday clothes, stands on its green
mound alone.</p>

<p class='c010' >Ere arriving at Modane, we passed the
superb fort of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lesseillon</span>, which tier above
tier crowns crag above crag, with its batteries
ready to sweep road and valley. The range of
cliffs to the right among which it rises are
wild and bare. In the depths of the gorge
under it, the Arc, narrowed to a streamlet, cuts
its passage between walls of rock; the stone
arch of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pont du Diable</span> spanning the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_385' id='Page_385'>385</a></span>
chasm, and nearer the fort a frailer wooden
bridge flung with yet more hardihood. The
mountain to the left, at whose base was our
road, hanging over the savage defile, was
clothed with a forest, and dashing down, or
trickling to our feet, cascade and torrent
wound among the roots of fir and larch, or
bounded over their branches. The only
neighbour of the fortress is a wretched village;
it must be a melancholy garrison: for some
time it made a fine object in the background
with the snows of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Cenis</span> and his companions.</p>

<p class='c010' >As we continued to descend, the clear green
stream of the Arc, sometimes wild and angry,
foams and roars among her masses of black
stone, sometimes flows mildly and brightly,
retreating from the road in coquettish curves,
half hiding itself in a fringe of birch and larch
and fir, and issuing again to smile at her admirers
and receive their homage. Nothing
can surpass in loveliness the valley of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maurienne</span>. Modane is a wretched hole,
beautifully placed, a blot in Paradise; the
noble road takes alternately both sides of the
narrow valley. At a spot which most claimed
admiration, we met a post carriage, its inmate
this warm day ensconced in great coat and
cap, fast asleep. We have once more the
hardy peasantry, a contrast to that of Italy,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_386' id='Page_386'>386</a></span>
the women with their fresh faces and thick
ankles, ascending the mountain paths followed
by their cows and goats tinkling their gay
bells; and we have also the pretty country
churches with their spires of grey stone peeping
over rocks and through pines instead of
the staring dome and unfinished Roman front of
those of Italian hamlets, which wanted money
as well as modesty. Avalanches of earth
have hereabouts injured the road, not yet
wholly repaired, and farther on the valley
narrowed and became bare and less beautiful,
and the rain fell heavily. At the next turn,
however, we saw St. Michel close by, beneath
and upon his noble crag, and galloped towards
the shelter the horses, who went lightly on as
if they had not been ridden three and thirty
miles.</p>

<p class='c010' >The landlord, who is an approved rogue,
asked prices which made us threaten him with
going to the other inn. He excused himself by
saying all his provisions were brought over
the mountain from Turin, so, as you may be
curious to hear what St. Michel imports from
Italy, our dinner consisted of two weary-looking
larks, a chicken who seemed pinched with
the cold of the snow-storm, a hard hearted
old cauliflower, one fish and three apples.</p>

<p class='c009' >Left St. Michel early as possible, (the mountains
before us, along whose edge a passage
from the road has been blasted, seeming to
shut in the valley,) skirting the bright river,
which widens and winds, forming birch and
fir islets, its small waves all golden, not from
the sun, which does not look down on them so
early, but the reflection of the autumnal
foliage on the hill side. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Jean de Maurienne</span>,
two posts farther, has a good inn; looking
back to it from the turn of the road, the
view was smiling and lovely. In the vestibule
of the cathedral are the tomb of Humbert of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_388' id='Page_388'>388</a></span>
the white hands, and others of the first counts
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Maurienne</span>, and in its treasury are preserved
the two fingers of John the Baptist,
with which it is said he baptized Jesus Christ.
According to the traditions of the country, a
young girl born in the environs went to Egypt,
whence she brought them back in a golden
box. Gontran, king of Burgundy and Orleans,
built, in the year 561, the church which
was destined to contain these precious relics,
and the town, tendering to them the respect
due, added two fingers to its arms!!</p>

<p class='c010' >The country surrounding <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Jean</span> produces
bears, and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maréchal de Vielleville</span>
tells an amusing anecdote relating to the
passage of Henry the Second of France in
1548:—</p>

<p class='c010' >“He was prayed by the bishop and the
inhabitants to honour them by making his
entry into their town with some pomp, promising
him some new diversion which would
gratify and was unknown to him. The king
consequently presented himself at the gates of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maurienne</span>, accompanied by a train suited to
royalty, but having entered and moved forward
about two hundred paces, he was suddenly
met by a company of men in bearskins,
but their heads, hands and feet as well as their
bodies so masked and accoutred, that they
might be taken for real bears, and issuing
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_389' id='Page_389'>389</a></span>
from a street to the beat of drum, banners
earned before them, and each bearing a pole
on his shoulder, placed themselves between
the king and his Swiss guards, marching four
and four, to the wonder of the court, and the
people conducted the king, who was marvellously
delighted at seeing bears so well
counterfeited, to the portal of the church,
where, according to custom, Henry dismounted,
and where the bishop and clergy waited his
coming, forming a station with cross and
relics, in their ornaments and richest attire,
and with sacred music to welcome him.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“The service over, the above named bears
brought the king back to his lodging, and
executed before it a thousand bearish gambols,
such as wrestling and climbing along the
houses and up the pillars of the market, and,
admirable to relate, they imitated with such
truth to nature, the howling of bears, that
one might have fancied oneself in the mountains;
and seeing that his majesty from his
apartments took great pleasure in watching
them, the whole hundred assembled beneath
and howled simultaneously a manner of salvo,
so fearful, that a great number of horses,
mounted by valets and lackeys, and in waiting
before the king’s lodging, broke violently
girths and reins, flung their riders, and dashed
in their terror over the bodies of all who stood
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_390' id='Page_390'>390</a></span>
on their passage. The king confessed he had
never been so gratified by rural device and
drollery, and bestowed two thousand crowns.”</p>

<p class='c010' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Jean de Maurienne</span> retains peculiar
customs and ceremonies on the occasion of
baptism, marriage and funeral. The cradle
of a male child, in honour of its sex, is carried
on the right shoulder, and the bells are rung to
welcome its birth; they are silent for a female,
and the left shoulder is the less dignified
place on which rests her cradle.</p>

<p class='c010' >The young man who aspires to the hand of
a maiden seeks her cottage at night, accompanied
by one comrade. If she places upright
in the chimney one of the logs burning
in the hearth, it is a token of his being rejected.
Should this fatal sign remain unmade,
preliminaries are entered upon, and the future
bridegroom invites his father-in-law to the
public-house, where all is arranged, and the
young man, reconducted to the cottage, gives
earnest-money to his intended wife. They are
then affianced without ceremony. The night
before the marriage the relations of both are
invited to the maiden’s house, who hides herself,
and is sought by her lover and his comrades,
and welcomed when found with rustic
music. The wedding morning, the friends and
guests, covered with cockades and laurel
branches, conduct the couple to church. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_391' id='Page_391'>391</a></span>
mother-in-law of the maiden waits her return
and receives her with various and symbolical
ceremonies. A broom is laid on her path; if
she forgets to take it up it is a mournful omen,
and a sign that she will prove a bad housewife.
Her mother-in-law throws a handful of
corn at her head in token of the plenty which
is to form the happiness of her household.</p>

<p class='c010' >She next finds placed before her a loaf,
which she is to cut and distribute to the poor,
and a kettle of broth wherewith to serve the
guests, in token of charity and hospitality.
Then follows the meal: a cake is brought in,
ornamented with laurel branches, and a child
carries round the table a plate, on which each
person lays his offering, which is presented to
the bride, and by her given to the poor.</p>

<p class='c010' >When a man dies in these countries, two of
his neighbours dig his grave, others carry him
thither, and the ceremony ends by a repast,
during which the guests drink to the memory
of the departed, and the health of those who
have “<em>made the ground</em>.” There are parishes
in which it is the custom to lay every Sunday,
during a year, a loaf and a pint of wine on
the dead man’s grave. If the decease takes
place on a Friday, it is a sign of new misfortune
to his family. The new-born child and
the person carrying it, who meet a funeral,
are destined to follow within a year.</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_392' id='Page_392'>392</a></span>
We passed <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Grande Maison,</span> a low inn by
the road-side, and a little further, arrived at
one of those sweet spots which make landmarks
in one’s memory—the entrance of a
village, beyond which the mountains meet
again; where a one-arched bridge spans the
river before a mass of black rock, and the remains
of one which former storms swept away,
and is now scarce visible through the vegetation
which covers it; and cottages on the
shore, with trellised vines and gay flower gardens
sloping to the water.</p>

<p class='c010' >We had lingered on the way, and it was
late and the fog rising, when we entered the
marshy valley in which stands <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aiguebelle</span>, at
whose entrance among the trees which cover
its summit may still be traced the ruins of
Carbonaria, or, as the Savoyards call it, the
Castle of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Charbonnière,</span> which was the
birthplace and the residence of the first counts
of Savoy, but, taken by Henry the Fourth,
was razed to the ground. At no great distance
from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aiguebelle</span>, is, or rather was, the
village of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Randans,</span> on which a mass of rock,
detached from that of Combes, slipped suddenly
down in June, 1750. The soil is now
on a level with the steeple of the church,
through whose windows it is possible to enter
the buried edifice. The inn of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aiguebelle</span> (la
Posta) good and comfortable.</p>

<span class='small'>5th November.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >A morning of clouds and vapour floating
over the hills, and hardly favourable to the
cold on my chest, which causes me some suffering;
a road all rises and falls, mud and stones,
but looking down on a fair valley, whose wooded
hillocks are again crowned with ruined castles.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maltaverne,</span> or <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chateauneuf,</span> as it is called,
may possess a good inn, but it looks unpromising;
I should be more inclined to try the
Balance at St. Ambrose, a little farther. At
last, from this narrow road which winds between
green hedges, descending abruptly, we
come on the rock of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmeillan,</span> (of whose
importance you can only on this side be aware,)
the high cliff commanding it, and the broad
bed of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Isère</span> below. From the bridge
which crosses the latter <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont Blanc</span> was not to-day
visible, hid in clouds called up by the
north-easter. The road skirts the dirty town,
and is carried across the lower portion of the
rock, (D—— said a surly No! to the innkeeper
who summoned us to his bad inn,) and
we rode on to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span>, through scenery
changed and saddened in the four months
which have elapsed since we left it, amongst
leafless walnut-trees and fading yellow poplars.
Found on the muddy road the white-haired
and half blind beggar, who was our
pensioner. He thanked me for my return
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_394' id='Page_394'>394</a></span>
gift, with “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci, mon garçon,</span>” and entering
by the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Faubourg Montmeillan,</span> Fanny
made no mistake, but passing scornfully the
Europe and Petit Paris, entered her own inn-yard.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>11th November.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Though really ill when I arrived, the comfortable
bed I found ready, and the care of
these kind people, who made <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tisanes</span> innumerable,
has already worked a cure. So
having found no letters, and having three days
borne with the anxiety the want of them occasioned,
I decided on leaving for Geneva,
where I had also desired they might be sent
on. As we were about to start this morning,
an <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">employé</span> of the post-office appeared bearer
of three, whose arrival took place before our
own, and my mind being at ease, we are to
take the road over the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont du Chat</span>, eleven
posts shorter than that by Geneva.</p>

<p class='c010' >To <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bourget,</span> the first post, we crossed the
plain, commencing only to ascend when we
had passed its village and ruined castle on the
lake shore. To us who expected a quiet promenade
on a hill-side, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont du Chat</span> was
a surprise; its bold zigzags, often without
parapets, leading to the very summit, the eye
looking perpendicularly down to the blue
water, and the autumnal foliage of the chestnut
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_395' id='Page_395'>395</a></span>
trees which cover a portion of its base,
and among which hides <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hautecombe.</span></p>

<p class='c010' >Beyond the abbey the foot of the Mont du
Chat is barren and wild, a mass of grey rock descending
to the lake without relief or verdure.
Aix, and the range of mountains at its back,
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont d’Azi,</span> and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dent de Nivolet,</span>
lie on the opposite shore, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chambéry</span> and his
snowy mountains behind, faintly outlined to-day
through mists called up by the hottest
sun which ever shone in November. Each
bend of the zigzags of this splendid road is
supported by a rounded wall from beneath,
resembling towers, and the first of which deceived
me, then on the look out for a Roman
ruin, and so determined on its discovery, as to
believe that this might be a part of the temple
raised to Mercury, whose foundations may
really be traced still on the little plain at the
summit of the pass. Not far beyond this level
of a few yards we rode by a ruin of another
date, being the remnant of a Gothic portal.
Descending once more, though the view had
lost its chief charm with the bright glory of
the lake of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bourget,</span> it yet possessed boldness
and grandeur, looking over broken hills topped
by towns, strangely grouped, and barren, and
terminated by the mountain of Tarare, recalling
Scott’s descriptions of border country.
On our path, beneath the jagged line of white
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_396' id='Page_396'>396</a></span>
cliff on the left, were green pastures, hiding
in nooks, belted with rocks and patches of
woodland through which peeped cottage chimneys,
and streams fringed with trees, the
trunks of prostrate elms serving for bridge
over them, and fair fresh children watching
the cattle which browsed on the strips of turf
along their banks. Arrived at the foot of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont du Chat</span>, we soon after reached Yenne,
a prettily-situated but most ill-favoured town,
beyond which the road continued level till
it suddenly crossed the bed of a torrent, one
of the Rhone’s tributaries. This being the
diligence route, they talk of building a bridge,
but the width of the winter bed would render
it a work of difficulty, though to-day the
stream was but about forty feet wide, and
barely reached our horses’ knees. A few
steps further brought us to the brink of the
Rhone, and within a most stern and solitary
glen, a valley of stone. On our left, where
its wall rose, its cold grey only varied by
stains the weather has made, bare of leaf or
living thing; on the right, and the river’s opposite
shore, greenly feathered to the summit,
and a mere line of crag, showing white among
the brushwood, like an embattled wall. A
sudden bend of the river parts it from the
road, which, scarcely broad enough for one
carriage, winds under and among tall crags,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_397' id='Page_397'>397</a></span>
scattered over turf like velvet, till it enters a
gallery formed by two of these, which might
serve for portal to Dante’s Inferno. The sides
are so high, and the aperture they leave so
narrow, that no sunshine penetrates to dissipate
its chill or darkness; and down the face
of its upper portion, and through the more
opaque mass which projects below, a winter
torrent, which now only trickles, has worn
itself a deep groove and circular passage.</p>

<p class='c010' >Emerging from the few yards of obscurity,
we were again on the bank of the rapid Rhone,
the frontier fortress of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pierre Châtel</span> crowning
the high grand cliff opposite, and before us the
light suspension bridge gracefully crossing the
river, uniting Savoy to France. Half way up
the cliff side and imbedded in it, a picturesque
object among trees and briars which spring
round, is a loopholed wall flanked by two
low towers, the private entrance to the fort, to
which conducts a stair cut in the living rock.
Arrived at the bridge, two stupid Savoy
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douaniers</span> detained us twenty minutes ere they
could understand our non-possession of receipts
for horse-duty, taken from us when the money
was returned. On the French shore, the men
said, that being a festival, they could not tell
whether Monsieur would or would not descend
from his pavilion to give the acquit à caution.
We observed that, if that were the case, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_398' id='Page_398'>398</a></span>
would do well to build an inn. The old gentleman
appeared on his terrace shrugging his
shoulders in sign of impatience, but at last
thought proper to come down, and the horses
being measured and the fifty-five francs paid,
we were allowed to ride on, having lost an
hour.</p>

<p class='c010' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pierre Châtel</span>, now a fortress, was once a
fortified monastery, raised by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amedée</span> the
Sixth, in the fourteenth century, who founded
the order of the collar of Savoy, now named
of the Annonciade, the Chartreuse of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pierre
Châtel</span> serving as chapel and place of assembly
for the knights of the order. It was only
when Bresse and Bugey had been ceded by
Charles Emmanuel to Henry the Fourth of
France, that the meetings of the knights of the
order were transferred to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmeillan,</span> and
not very long since the armorial bearings of
those received during the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries were still hung in one of the
vast halls.</p>

<p class='c010' >The road passing from the bridge beneath
the crag on which the fortress stands, though
quitting the Rhone here, continues very beautiful
as far as Bellay, bold in the distance and
wooded near,—but the hills are frequent and
fatiguing, and the last the worst, as the town
is perched on a pinnacle. The miserable inn
is on the Place, and the window of our
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_399' id='Page_399'>399</a></span>
bedroom looked on the closed office of the notary
Peytel. You may remember that the 31st of
October twelvemonth, driving home in his
cabriolet from Bourg, to obtain sole command
of her fortune, he murdered his young wife,
having first shot the servant, (a man of irreproachable
character,) as on him was to lie the
weight of the crime. The story Peytel told
was at first believed, but his forgetfulness had
left his servant’s still loaded pistols on his
person, and his guilt came strangely to light.
His fellow notaries, not liking the stain of an
execution on their brotherhood, drew up a
petition in his favour. It appears that notwithstanding
his double murder, he excited
sympathy, and himself believed in the possibility
of pardon; and bearing out the assertion
“that all the world is a stage and the
men merely players,” to obtain a last dramatic
effect he embraced the gaoler’s wife ere he
went to execution, and bade her mark that his
countenance had undergone no change. The
servant, while lighting my fire, said his sister
had gone to Paris to petition the king, but
had done so in vain, because it was said that
Peytel was not a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brave homme</span></i>, as this was not
his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">première fois</span></i>. So that, according to Fanchette’s
code of morality, a man may be a
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brave homme</span></i> who commits murder only a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">première
fois</span></i>. Bad dinner and bad beds.</p>

The hostler asked D—— if I did not belong
to a peculiar race called Amazons, always attired
thus.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pont d’Ain</span>, 12th November.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Rose early to leave Bellay ditto, and were
detained by seeing the rain pouring down on
the melancholy Place, and the red umbrellas
of people who crossed it in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sabots,</span> and the
dripping diligence just arrived, wrinkling
the widened gutter where half a dozen ducks
were dipping their heads in the water and
seemed triumphing in their superior powers
of enjoyment. As the inn was not tempting,
we left it as soon as the shower in some
degree subsided, and a short distance and
gentle ascent brought us to the identical
bridge, the scene of the murder. It crosses a
sluggish stream which creeps on either side of
it and of the road over low and marshy meadows.
The spot has a melancholy aspect,
partly perhaps from its associations and the
weather on which we saw it. A few fine oaks
grow here and there, near one of which the
man was murdered, and within hearing are
several cottages, one so close that its inhabitants
might almost, had the moon been bright
(for it was eleven o’clock), have seen what was
passing. The marsh, to which she fled in her
terror, was on the right hand as we approached
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_401' id='Page_401'>401</a></span>
the bridge, and having pursued and shot her
there, he feared she was not quite dead, and
ere he feigned to seek assistance, laid her,
face downwards, in the water, and preserving
his coolness when he returned, placed her
corpse in the cabriolet and drove beside his
victim into Bellay.</p>

<p class='c010' >Our road entered a desolate glen, where
the deposits formed by the heavy rains have
made small lakes or rather large pools under
the bare hills. This melancholy valley is
succeeded by one of surpassing beauty, for
there are crags still grey and shattered but
peeping above wooded hills on which stand
the proud ruins of convent and castle, or with
vineyards growing up their sides, the clear
water of the rapid stream at their foot flashing
as it turns watermills, and in the hollow where
it flows so busily, oak and chestnut, and walnut,
and ash-trees, forming groves rich and varied,
interspersed with clumps of dark box and
portions of fallen rock bright with the delicate
greens of the mosses which cover them.</p>

<p class='c010' >We passed St. Rambert, beautifully placed
on the river’s edge, with its ancient fortress
above and the ruin of another stronghold like
itself on an eminence which rises from the flat
surface of the valley. Two leagues before
arriving at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pont d’Ain</span>, we bade a final adieu
to this lovely country, and issued on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_402' id='Page_402'>402</a></span>
plains of France. As it was growing dusk, we
less regretted the change, and Fanny, finding
a strip of turf by the road-side, shook her small
head and cantered on merrily. There is a fine
bridge at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pont d’Ain</span>, and the inn is good,
though dear.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>13th November.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >A lovely morning; Bourg is prettily placed,
for the plain has undulations and patches of
copse wood, and you look back to the mountains
of Savoy. Left the cathedral of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Brou</span> on
the right hand just before entering the town,
a large building of not perhaps the purest
Gothic, but picturesque notwithstanding, and
within of remarkable beauty. Early in the
year 1120, there stood on this spot a monastery,
whither Ulric, Lord of Bresse, returned from
the Holy Land to end his days. The Duchess
of Savoy, wife of Philip the Second, made a
vow to build here a splendid church and
convent should her husband escape the consequences
of a dangerous fall. Commenced by
the latter, they were left unfinished, for he
died in 1497. His son Philibert succeeded
him; he had espoused Margaret of Austria,
daughter of the Emperor Maximilian and of
Mary of Burgundy. Twice affianced, to Charles
the Eighth of France, and John, heir to the
Spanish throne, she married Philibert,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_403' id='Page_403'>403</a></span>
surnamed the Handsome in 1501, and in 1504
was left a widow and childless. She had Bresse
for dowry, and the government of Burgundy
from her father, so that seeing herself rich
and uncontrolled, she undertook to accomplish
her mother-in-law’s vow, and raised the
cathedral as it now stands between the years
1511 and 1530. The tombs of the old duchess,
its first founder, and that of Philip, are there,
as are those of Philibert the Handsome and
Margaret herself. On her monument is inscribed
the singular motto—</p>
<div class='c011'><span class='small'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fortune, Infortune, fors une.</span></span></div>
<p class='c012' >Unluckily for our progress it was fair time
at Bourg, and the crowd of peasants in their
short boddices and flat hats, which, surmounted
by a black lace turret and ornamented by
black lace streamers, are placed at the top of
their ugly heads, literally stopped the way.
One pretty girl (the only one) looked well
under it. The boddice and short sleeves are
ornamented with fringe, black lace, and rags
innumerable, and the arms are bare, saving
in those who, exhibiting great luxury, have
worsted gloves confined above the elbow by
elastic garters. Passing towards the centre
of the fair, where the thickest crowd stood
gaping round the tent which contained
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_404' id='Page_404'>404</a></span>
Franconi’s troop, a fat man came rushing forth
from a café, and with one hand on my rein
and the other on my arm, inquired whether I
would take any thing, and whether the horses
had been fed, so affectionately, that I had
great trouble in getting rid of him.</p>

<p class='c010' >My heart sank when I saw Montrevel, where
the landlady of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pont d’Ain</span> had said we should
be “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas mal,</span>” and the poor woman, with fear in
her face, told me she had never lodged travellers
before. However, when I had groped
after her up the dark ladder-staircase, and
passed the room in which slept the whole
family, three dogs included, we found one
better than I expected, as it was large as a
barn, and clean, though damp, as never used
save for festivals, wedding, or christening.
We made a good fire on the one lonely dog,
and got supper, whose best dish was one of
roasted chestnuts, and dry sheets over hard,
moist mattresses, the beds being there for
ornament. To the stable, while D—— stood
there to see the horses fed, came a peasant in
blue frock and striped night-cap, who watched,
in respect and some awe, Fanny’s demeanour,
never of the quietest when she is curried, and
at last said, “Those animals have far more
sense than we have.” D—— thought from
his face that might easily be, and said, “Very
true;” but with another look of admiration he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_405' id='Page_405'>405</a></span>
returned to the charge, and said, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vous venez
de travailler à Bourg,</span>” which D——, not
quite comprehending, explanations followed;
and it came out that he thought we belonged
to Franconi’s troop (as did I suppose the fat
man at the café) and were all four performers.</p>

<p class='c010' >Left Montrevel for Tournus, the greater
part of the way a desolate flat, beneath the
cold fog, broken by a few hills, long as uninteresting.
The peasants of La Bresse are
a quiet though uncouth set of people; their
miserable habitations cleaner than those of the
more northern provinces of France. Met no
one save a group of gipsies, on whom we came
as I walked to warm myself down one of
these quasi mountains, Fanny following like
a spaniel. They were gathered beneath an
ancient oak, the older people cooking, a handsome
youth touching a guitar, and a girl, with
the dark fine features of her race, gazing at
him as did the large dog, whose head rested on
her knee. Outside the bridge of Tournus, found
at a café the stout old gentleman, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame
Lalouet’s pensionnaire,</span> who, on our former
visit, provided us with a château and private
theatre. We shook hands, and he told us we
should be welcome at the inn, as indeed we
found on our arrival, for it is one of the very
best on the road.</p>
<div class='c008'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_406' id='Page_406'>406</a></span>
<span class='small'>14th November.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Left Tournus for <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chalons</span> the 14th November,
in cold fog and drizzling rain; the view
of the town and its towers, and the windings of
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saône</span>, which I thought pretty when we
rode here on a sunny morning, having lost its
charm now, seen through the mist which lay
heavily on the few leafless trees, and the waves
of mud of the straight road before us. Before
reaching <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chalons</span> we came again on the
broken, bad <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pavé</span>; the sides of the road impassable,
as our horses slipped or sunk into
the heavy ground almost to the knee. Arrived
at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel du Parc;</span> uncomfortable as before.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>15th November.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >A lovely morning, though the fog overtook
us, and the last of our rides which possessed
any interest; for, after Chagny’s plain and
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pavé,</span> we entered the valley, and passed the
ruins of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Rochepot;</span> they had less beauty in
the gleam of November sunshine, and clouds
and mist hid the plains of Bresse, and the line
of snowy mountains which terminated the
view. The moor beyond, soaked by autumnal
rains, was too heavy to canter over; and the
oak wood, beyond <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Givry,</span> exhibits now but a
few brown leaves, clinging mournfully to twigs
almost bare. Recognized by postilions who
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_407' id='Page_407'>407</a></span>
met us on the road in April, and arrived at
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arnay le Duc</span> by moonlight.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>16th November.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >As it rains now every other day, it rained
this morning, and our hostess as we left her
shrugged her shoulders at our insanity. We
hoped to pass Rouvray and reach Avallon,
but when two leagues and a half from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Roche
en Breuil,</span> Grizzy dropped a hind shoe, and
we were retarded by the necessity of leading
her thither, for in the two wretched villages
we rode through, there was no farrier. Entering
Rouvray, Fanny dropped one of hers put
on at Florence, and we went to and were
well received at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ancienne Poste,</span> our old
quarters.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>17th November.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Wished to get on to Auxerre, for the day
was warm and lovely, but to do so took unwisely
our host’s advice, and a short cut by an
abandoned route, where we sank into mud,
and scrambled over stones and rode through
a deep stream, till at the first village we
reached we were very happy to inquire the
way to join the high road again, and thus
doubling instead of saving distance, and climbing
the long hills of Burgundy, it was already
dark when we reached St. Bris. We reckoned
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_408' id='Page_408'>408</a></span>
on the moon, but she was hid in heavy clouds
till we reached Vermenton, where, her light no
longer needed, she shone forth splendidly.</p>

<p class='c010' >The inn is the last house in the dirty town,
and though frequented by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rouliers</span> only, whose
waggons, with their dogs guarding them, were
ranged before the door in the moonlight, we
found there, with a good humoured fat landlady,
good dinner, beds and fire, and our
horses a private stable, but the waggoners
sing at supper and get up at two to prepare
for starting at four, so that our rest was of the
shortest. Beyond Vermenton there is another
long hill, steeper than any we have travelled
since those of the Appennines. The heavy fog
froze on our cloaks, hiding the view of the
bare hills beyond our marl road, the only
good one between Paris and Bourg, till we
drew near Auxerre, where we fed our horses,
and the weather changed during our short
stay, as the sun shone out with oppressive
splendour. For some miles ere we reached
Joigny, the badness of the road retarded us,
and the sun had set when we stopped at the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hôtel de Bourgogne,</span> one of the good inns on
our passage.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>19th November.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >When half a league out of Joigny, D——
discovered that he had left the small valise in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_409' id='Page_409'>409</a></span>
the manger, and commissioned to return for it
a young man who for some time, walking
lightly along, had kept pace with our horses,
and had just laughed heartily at an old marketwoman,
who, riding her donkey in masculine
guise, treated with some contempt me and my
saddle. He said it was a happy chance for
him, as he was on his way from Bordeaux to
Paris, and had spent his last halfpenny, having
paid four sous for his night’s lodging, and
eaten neither supper nor breakfast. He ran
to Joigny and back, and when he came up
with us once more, we noticed that his shoe was
cut, and praised his diligence. He said he had
been a far better walker before the beam of a
house, which was taking down, had fallen on
his foot and crushed it. As he took from D——
the money which was to convey him the remainder
of his way, he drew his left hand a
moment from his waistcoat pocket, and I saw
it was crippled. So here was a poor fellow,
with no breakfast, and no money, and no hope
of either, walking to Paris miles away, with
a useless hand and injured foot, neither desponding
nor trying to excite compassion, nor
asking charity, nor servile when it was bestowed—proving
again what I have observed
so often, that the French bear privation and
misfortune better than any people in the
world. He said he should be well provided
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_410' id='Page_410'>410</a></span>
for as soon as he arrived in Paris, as he wrote
a fair hand, and his brother established there
had a place of clerk awaiting him. At the
first village we came to, he stopped for his
morning meal, and we saw no more of him.</p>

<p class='c010' >At <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Villeneuve</span> le Roy we fed and rested our
horses, and again lingered too long. Passed
through Sens, the prettiest of French towns,
and before its cathedral, without stopping.
The chapter of Sens is unfortunately poor, and
has lately sold ancient tapestries and curious
relics to pay the expenses of its repairs.
A part of this money has been expended in
raising statues outside the building, and the
sculptor has so executed his mission, that
several are most remarkable as being very
crooked; and one, in particular, whose arms
are folded, leans to one side, perilously for
those below, as he is ninety feet from the
ground. Night closed in as we reached <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pont-sur-Yonne,</span>
for we had again counted on a
faithless moon; and as the trees, which bordered
the bad road, had been lately felled
and lay across it, we proceeded slowly and all
rather wearily, till the moon shone out from
behind a cloud, and Fanny knew her way and
trotted on first and stopped at the inn gate.
The landlady received us gratefully, as since our
passage she has lodged several families who
went to her on my recommendation, and we
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_411' id='Page_411'>411</a></span>
have enjoyed the best supper by the blazing
fire in her best room, hung round with <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Don
Quixote’s</span> adventures.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>20th November.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Left <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Villeneuve le Guiard</span> for Melun in
threatening weather, following the Fontainebleau
road as far as Fossard, but the skies
compensated for their yesterday’s kindness,
and the cold north-easter blew in our faces
the coldest of all possible rains. The horses
hung their heads, and so did we: for there was
neither bank nor bush to shelter us. Where
the road turns off at Fossard, there appears
to be a good inn, which we passed crest-fallen,
crossing the bridge of Montereau, where <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jean
sans Peur</span>, duke of Burgundy, was murdered.</p>

<p class='c010' >Not stopping to see his sword, which hangs
in the church, we travelled with more discontent
than curiosity up the long hill which
rises from the dirty Yonne. My hat, lately
purchased in a country town, proving only
felt, and softened by rain till it clung to my
throat like a black silk handkerchief: rain
almost the whole weary day, and the road
crossing a wood, thin, stunted and leafless, so
affording no shelter. Ere entering Melun, the
shoe of Grizzle’s obstinate hind foot, and the
two fore shoes of Fanny, were discovered to be
loose, and must be put on ere we leave to-morrow.
This inn, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel de France,</span> is a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_412' id='Page_412'>412</a></span>
contrast and a foil to its Fontainebleau namesake,
being as bad as its masters are uncivil.
Poisoned at dinner by some <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chicorée,</span> dressed
in a dirty copper saucepan.</p>
<div class='c008'><span class='small'>Paris, 21st November.</span></div>
<p class='c010' >Very unwell all night, but up with dawn, as
the shoeing of our horses by a country farrier
is an operation long and perilous. If I had
seen yesterday before dinner the aides de
cuisine I watched this morning preparing
vegetables in the yard, the sight of them
would have cured hunger and spared illness.
The rain held off till we got on horseback,
and then came down and continued in torrents
till we reached Charenton, accompanied by
wind and fog; so that the deluge joined
to the extreme fatigue which I felt at last,
and the sick faintness consequent on eating
verdigrease, I suffered more than any
day of our journey, and, being last, it
seemed the longest. At Charenton the rain
abating, the horses dried, and we cheered up,
and as it grew dark arrived at the Place de la
Bastille. When we reached the quays, Fanny,
though far from home, still knew her way,
pricked her ears and hurried her pace, and,
when on the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place Louis Quinze,</span> took unbidden
the way to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Champs Elysées,</span> and
cantered up them towards her old habitation.</p>

<p class='c010' >There are always moments of anxiety
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_413' id='Page_413'>413</a></span>
preceding the meeting with friends after months
of absence, and the heart beats painfully as
one stops before the door, uncertain of the
well-being of those within. My father’s voice
from the window reassured me, and we
entered, hopeless looking figures, wet to the
skin, and muddy to the knee. “Sure such a
pair were never seen!”</p>

<p class='c010' >It was luxury to close round the fire, talking
all at once; to feel we did not care whether it
snowed or shone on the morrow, as our long
march was at an end at last, and our comrades
consigned to the care of their old attendant,
whom they recognized and caressed, after
their manner, and who walked triumphantly
away with his travelled Fanny.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>APPENDIX.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c018' >The crime of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cinq Mars</span> consisted in his treating all
means as allowable, provided they had for end the
favourite’s downfall; his treason to Louis; his appeal
to Spain. The fault of De Thou lay in his preference
to an individual over his country, in private affections
too strong for public virtues. An extract from
Montresor’s Memoirs, detailing the last days of their
lives, must find a place here. By translating closely,
I have tried as much as possible to preserve the
manner of the quaint original—“Journal of all which
took place in Lyons during the Proceedings instituted
for the Trial of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messrs. de Cinq Mars</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de Thou.</span>”</p>

<p class='c010' >‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Cinq Mars</span> arrived at Lyons the 4th of
September of the present year 1642, about two hours
after noon, in a coach drawn by four horses, in which
were four <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gardes du corps</span> carrying their muskets, and
surrounded by foot guards, belonging to the Cardinal
Duke’s household, to the number of one hundred.
Before the carriage marched two hundred horsemen,
for the most part Catalonians, and three hundred more
well mounted followed. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le Grand</span><a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c019'><sup>[1]</sup></a> was
attired in musk coloured cloth of Holland covered over
with gold embroidery, having a scarlet cloak with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_420' id='Page_420'>420</a></span>
large silver buttons. Being arrived on the bridge
which crosses the Rhone before entering the town, he
asked <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Ceton,</span><a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c019'><sup>[2]</sup></a> lieutenant of the Scotch
guards, if he permitted that the coach should be
closed. This was refused him, and he was conducted to
the bridge of St. Jean, thence to the Exchange and by
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue de Flandres</span> to the foot of the castle of Pierre
Encise. As he passed along the streets, continually
showing himself at the carriage door, he saluted the
crowd with a smiling countenance, leaning half out of
the coach, and even recognized many to whom he
bowed, calling them by name. Arrived beneath Pierre
Encise, he was surprised when told he must descend,
and mount on horseback to arrive at the castle by a
road which skirted the town: “This then,” he said,
“will be the last time.” He had imagined that orders
were given to conduct him to Vincennes, and had several
times asked the guards if would be permitted hunting
when arrived there.</p>

<p class='c010' >‘His prison was situated at the foot of the great
tower, having for only view that from the two narrow
windows which looked on a small garden, beneath
which were stationed guards, as well as in his chamber,
where <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur Ceton</span> with four soldiers lay, in that
adjoining and without all the doors.</p>

<p class='c010' >‘The next day, fifth of the month, the Cardinal
Bichy went to visit him, and asked if it were his
pleasure to see some one in his prison with whom he
might converse. He said he should be glad of such
favour, but that he did not deserve that for him any
should be troubled.</p>

<p class='c010' >‘Whereupon the Cardinal of Lyons summoned the
Jesuit Malavette, desiring that, since such was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_421' id='Page_421'>421</a></span>
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Cinq Mars’</span> will, he should go thither; and
he went on the 6th at five in the morning, remaining
until eight. He found him laid in a bed of scarlet
damask, incommoded by a stomach disorder which
had annoyed him throughout his journey and of which
he was not rid till his death, and therefore very feeble
and pale. The priest’s converse so solaced him, that
again that night he prayed his company, and afterwards
during the days his imprisonment lasted continued
to see him eve and morning. When all was
over, the above named father rendered an account to
the Cardinal Duke (Richelieu), and the Cardinal of
Lyons, and the chancellor, of all which he had said to
him, and remained a long while in conference with
his Ducal Eminence, although at that time he allowed
himself to be seen by no one.</p>

<p class='c010' >‘The 7th day of the month, the chancellor visited
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Cinq Mars,</span> and treated him courteously,
saying he had no reasons for fear, but all for hope;
that he knew he had an upright judge, mindful of
favours received from his benefactor, since through
his goodness, and his power only, the king had not
dispossessed him from his office, and this great kindness
deserved not only an eternal remembrance, but
to be repaid with infinite gratitude. The pretended
occasion of this compliment was that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le
Grand</span> had once heretofore appeased the king’s anger
greatly excited against the chancellor, but the true
reason of his civility was a fear of being refused by
him for judge and also of his appealing to the parliament
of Paris, and being delivered by the people, by
whom he was loved passionately. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le Grand</span>
replied, that he thanked him for a courtesy whose excess
confused him, but “nevertheless,” he said, “I note
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_422' id='Page_422'>422</a></span>
well from the mode in which this affair proceeds that
my life is the mark aimed at. Sir, my fate is sealed, the
king forsakes me; I look on myself henceforth but as
a victim about to be sacrificed to mine enemies’ passion
and the king’s easy temper.” To this the chancellor
answered, “that such opinions were erroneous, and
by nothing warranted, and that his own experience
brought with it a contrary conviction.” “Heaven
grant it,” replied <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le Grand;</span> “but I believe
it not.” The 8th day of the month, the chancellor
went to hear him, accompanied by six <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maîtres de
requêtes,</span> two presidents, and six counsellors from
Grenoble; but, having interrogated him from seven in
the morning till two hours after noon, they could
extract no replies.</p>

<p class='c010' >‘The 10th, they departed altogether for Vivey, a
mansion belonging to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé</span> of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aisnay, Monsieur
de Villeroy’s</span> brother, two leagues distant from Lyons,
whither Monsieur, the king’s brother, repaired from
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Villefranche,</span> and where all proofs and papers were
compared and examined.</p>

<p class='c010' >‘The 12th, all the judges sitting in Lyons, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur
le Grand</span> was brought thither in a coach from
the castle at about eight o’clock in the forenoon,
conducted by the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chevalier du guet,</span>” and his company,
and being introduced and placed in the accused’s seat,
he answered and confessed all which he had already
made known to the chancellor in that conference
which, on the 7th of the month, they had held together,
and with gentleness and tranquillity of mind so great
withal, that his judges gazed one at the other in wonder
and admiration, constrained to acknowledge that never
before had they seen or heard of constancy so unshaken,
or a mind so strong and clear. After this he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_423' id='Page_423'>423</a></span>
was bid retire to a chamber, whither, soon as the
chancellor had collected the votes, and his condemnation
was written, they entered to read to him
his sentence; and also that before its execution, the
question, both ordinary and extraordinary, should be
administered, in order to obtain from him more fully,
the declaration of who were his accomplices.</p>

<p class='c010' >‘During the performance of this mournful office,
which drew tears from the eyes of his judges and his
guards, he neither changed colour nor countenance,
losing nothing of his accustomed cheerfulness and that
air of majesty which accompanied all his actions; but
towards its close, at the mention of torture, he said to
his judges, though with unaltered mildness, “Sirs, this
seems harsh to me; a person of my age and my condition
should scarce be subjected to these formalities.
I know what the forms of justice demand, but I know
mine own rank also. I have told, and will again tell all;
I receive death with willingness and unflinchingly, and
therefore is the torture needless. I confess my weakness,
and that this prospect hath power to disturb me.”</p>

<p class='c010' >‘He continued his speech yet some time farther,
with so much grace and gentleness, that his judges’
compassion prevented their reply, in contradiction, or
refusal of that indulgence he hoped to obtain from
them.</p>

<p class='c010' >‘Father Malavette at this time arriving inquired of
him what might be the subject of his demand, saying
that these were gentlemen well nurtured, and that from
them he might expect as much favour as from the
king.</p>

<p class='c010' >‘“It is of small moment, father,” he replied; “I do
but confess a weakness and that it paineth me to
submit to the torture; disturbing my spirit not from
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_424' id='Page_424'>424</a></span>
apprehension of pain, for I shall go unto death with
joy and firmness, but because, having told all I know,
it were vain to use torture.”</p>

<p class='c010' >‘The father, embracing him, answered, “Sir, be not
uneasy; you have no concern with merciless judges,
since already they give your ill fortune tears;” and
taking aside two of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maîtres de requêtes,</span>” the priest
told them that they mistook this master spirit; that he
saw well the extreme constraint he imposed upon
himself, and that they did ill so to shake his fortitude
as to risk the casting it down. The while he spoke
came thither two judges more, who said in secret to
the priest, that the question would not be administered
to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le Grand,</span> but that, for the sake of justice
and in obedience to its forms, they must conduct him
to the torture chamber. Whereupon the reverend
father accosted <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cinq Mars,</span> and drawing him aside
from his guards, he said, “Are you capable of keeping
an important secret?” He said, “Father, I pray
you to believe I have been wanting in faith to none save
God.” “Well then,” he returned, “you will not suffer,
nor will you be presented to the torture; you come only
to the chamber, whither I will accompany you in
guarantee of the word I pledge you.”</p>

<p class='c010' >‘They went together, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le Grand</span> merely
saw the cords and other fearful instruments of torture.
Meanwhile about ten o’clock, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Thou</span> was
conducted from the castle of Pierre Encise to the
palace, and presented to the judges to be interrogated
there; and after the usual demands, the chancellor
asked whether <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur d’Effiat (de Cinq Mars)</span> had
not revealed to him the conspiracy? To which he
made answer: “Gentlemen, I might deny, and absolutely,
that I knew aught of this, nor could you
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_425' id='Page_425'>425</a></span>
convict me of falsehood, for by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Cinq
Mars</span> only you can be apprised of my knowledge,
since to no man breathing have I spoken or written
on the subject. An accused man cannot validly accuse
another, and a man cannot be condemned to death
save by the testimony of two irreproachable witnesses.
Thus you see that my life, my death, my condemnation
or absolution rest on mine own tongue; nevertheless,
gentlemen, I confess that I knew of this matter. I
avow it frankly for two reasons. First, because the
three months of my imprisonment I have so passed
in contemplation of life and death, as to know undoubtingly,
that however long the life I may enjoy, it
can only be unhappy. And that death is an advantage
to me, seeing I hold it as the most certain proof of
my election; such as renders me ready to die, for
which I can never be better disposed than now.
Wherefore I would not let pass this opportunity of
salvation. My second reason is, that, notwithstanding
this my crime be punishable with death, nevertheless,
gentlemen, you observe that it is neither extraordinary,
nor of great magnitude, nor of deep dye. I do confess
I knew the plot; I did all that in me lay to dissuade
him from its accomplishment. He believed me his
only and devoted friend, and I would not betray him;
therefore I deserve death and I condemn myself by
the law, Quisquis....”</p>

<p class='c010' >‘This speech, which he spoke with a wondrous spirit
and vivacity, so favourably impressed his judges, that
with difficulty they roused themselves from the feelings
it excited, nor was there one there present who felt not
a passionate inclination to save him and preserve to
France the brightest hope of her court, for so was
he called even by his foes.</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_426' id='Page_426'>426</a></span>
He was thereupon sentenced to death, as well as
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le Grand;</span> and as he quitted the hall he met
there the reverend father Mambrun the Jesuit, who
in Pierre Encise had confessed him, and he exclaimed
in a religious transport, “Come, on my father, let us
go to death and to heaven; let us forward to true
glory. What through life have I done for my God
to obtain from him this favour he now grants me, to
die ignominiously that I may sooner arrive at true
life?” and expressing the same thought unceasingly,
he was conducted to the chamber where was <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur
de Cinq Mars.</span> Soon as the latter perceived him, he
ran towards him exclaiming, “Oh! friend, friend,
how I mourn thy doom!” but <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Thou</span>
embracing him, said, “Ah how happy we are to die
thus!” The one asked pardon of the other; they
embraced five or six times successively with claspings
of a most unmatched love; bidding their very guards
burst into tears, for this was such a spectacle as might
soften rocks.</p>

<p class='c010' >‘While these embracings lasted, three or four of their
judges came; which obliged them to retire to the
extremity of the chamber, where they conversed yet
half an hour with most entire affection, of which they
gave proof by exclamation and gesture, the while the
Father Malavette prayed the judges who were there to
promise him that they should not be bound, neither see
the executioner till arrived on the scaffold, which was
granted after some slight difficulty. And still while
this lasted, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le Grand</span> embraced <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de
Thou,</span> ending his discourse thus: “Dear friend, let us
go to think on God, and employ the remainder of our
lives in working out our salvation.”</p>

<p class='c010' >‘“It is well said,” replied <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Thou,</span> and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_427' id='Page_427'>427</a></span>
taking his confessor by the hand, he led him to a
corner of the chamber and made his confession there.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Cinq Mars</span> begged of the guards that
they would give him another chamber, which they
refused, saying that one was spacious enough, and that
if so pleased him to go to the other corner, he might
confess himself with all convenience. But still urging
his request with grace and mildness, he at last obtained
that he asked for. Being entered into another chamber,
he made a general confession of his whole life, which
lasted a long hour; then wrote three letters, the one
to his mother the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maréchale d’Effiat,</span> wherein he
prayed her to make payment to two creditors, to whom
he wrote two other letters. After which he said to
the priest that he could bear up no longer, having
swallowed nothing during twenty-four hours.</p>

<p class='c010' >‘The father prayed his comrade to go in search of
wine and eggs, and the guards having brought both,
he begged them to place all on the table. When
they had gone forth, the said father offered him wine,
but he rinsed his mouth only and swallowed nothing.
Meanwhile <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Thou</span> had confessed himself,
and with marvellous promptitude indited two letters,
and this done, paced the chamber reciting aloud the
psalm, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Miserere mei, Deus,</span>” with enthusiasm of
mind so shown in the movements of his body, that it
seemed he were about to take flight from earth. He
repeated the same verses ofttimes, exclaiming aloud
and with ejaculations, mingling in his oration passages
from St. Paul and the Holy Scripture, then taking up
the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Miserere</span>” once more, and reciting nine times
after it, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Secundum magnam misericordiam tuam.</span>”</p>

<p class='c010' >‘During these devotions came several gentlemen
to pay their respects to him, but he waved them
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_428' id='Page_428'>428</a></span>
aside, “My thoughts are with God, I pray you disturb
me not, I am no longer of this world.” Notwithstanding
this ecstacy, there approached him one gentleman sent
by his sister the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Présidente Pontac,</span> who had come to
Lyons to intercede for her brother. He asked him
from her if he wanted aught, and he replied, “I need
nothing, sir, saving her prayers and yours; nothing
but death to conduct me to life and glory.” And
as he commenced reciting the psalm, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Credidi propter
quod locutus sum,</span>” the guardian of the convent <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">des
Observantins</span> of Tarascon, who had confessed him in
prison there, came near and inquired what inscription
he chose on the chapel founded by himself in their
convent. He replied, “What you will, my father;” but
the latter urging his request, he asked for a pen, and
with such wondrous promptitude as showed more than
human facility and presence of mind, he wrote, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Christo
liberatori votum in carcere pro libertate conceptum
Franciscus Augustus Thuanus è carcere vita jam
liberandus, merito solvit.</span>”</p>

<p class='c010' >‘Having laid down the pen, he recommenced his
prayers, reciting the psalm “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Confitebor tibi, Domine,
in toto corde meo,</span>” yielding to such enthusiasm as
at times almost overcame him. The guards looked
on trembling themselves with respect and awe. One of
their judges arrived in the meantime, demanding what
they waited for, and where was <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le Grand.</span> One
knocked at his chamber door where he still was with
his confessor, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Cinq Mars</span> replied with
his admirable gentleness, that it would be finished soon,
and once more drawing the priest aside, he spake to
him of his conscience with such feeling of his own
offences, and of the goodness of God, that the priest
perforce embraced him, adoring in his person the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_429' id='Page_429'>429</a></span>
might of God’s grace and that of the mind of man; and
then they prepared themselves to go forth. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur
le Grand</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Thou</span> being met on the steps,
and having exchanged salutes, they encouraged one
another with zeal and joy, such as proved that the Holy
Spirit of a truth had filled their souls and bodies.
At the foot of the steps they found their judges, and
each made to them a fair speech with thanks for the
mild treatment granted them.</p>

<p class='c010' >‘Being on the steps without the hall, they gazed
attentively at the great crowd assembled before the
palace, and bowed on all sides low and gracefully.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Thou,</span> seeing how they were to be conducted
in a coach to the place of execution, said aloud to the
people, “Gentlemen, this is indeed goodness to carry
thus two criminals to their death, we who merit to be
drawn thither in a cart and dragged on hurdles—the
Son of God, the symbol of innocence, having been for
us so done to death with shame and scandal.”</p>

<p class='c010' >‘After this they entered the coach which had been
prepared for them. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs de Cinq Mars</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de
Thou</span> placed themselves in the back seat, the two priests’
companions opposite the confessors themselves, one
at either door, the guards who accompanied them
being about a hundred, belonging to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chevalier du
guet,</span> with three hundred <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuirassiers,</span> the officers of
justice and the provost marshal. They began this sad
journey reciting the litanies of the Holy Virgin, after
which <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Thou</span> embraced <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Cinq
Mars</span> four separate times with the ardour of an angel,
saying, “Dear friend, what during our lives have we
done so pleasing to God as to induce him to do us the
favour to die together? with a little infamy to wipe
away our crimes, by a slight shame to conquer heaven
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_430' id='Page_430'>430</a></span>
and its glory? Alas! is it not true that we have not
deserved it? let us mortify our hearts and spend our
strength in thankfulness, and receive death with all the
affection of our souls.”</p>

<p class='c010' >‘To this <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le Grand</span> replied by such words
of virtue, faith, charity and resignation, as exalted
their confessors above themselves. The people so
thronged in the streets that the coach could hardly
move forward, and the despair was such as for like
cause has seldom been seen depicted on human countenances.
Arrived at the slope of the bridge of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saône, Monsieur de Thou</span> said to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Cinq
Mars,</span> “Well, dear friend, who shall first die?” “Your
choice shall decide,” he answered. Father Malavette,
now speaking, said to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Thou,</span> “You are
the oldest.” “True,” replied <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Thou;</span> but
turning to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cinq Mars,</span> “You are the most generous,
you will show me the road to heaven and glory.”
“Alas,” said <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cinq Mars,</span> “I opened before you the
path to the precipice, but let us fling ourselves there
bravely, and we shall rise to the brightness and
happiness of God.”</p>

<p class='c010' >‘During the remainder of the way, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de
Cinq Mars,</span> continuing his acts of piety, recommended
himself to the people’s prayers, putting his head forth
from the carriage windows. A group of young girls
moved withal uttered a great cry, and Father Malavette,
affected by their sorrow, could not restrain his
own and wept: but <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le Grand,</span> observing him,
said, “How, father, are you more interested for me
than I for myself? I pray you shed no tears, we need
your firmness to fortify our own.”</p>

<p class='c010' >‘As to the Jesuit Mambrun, he was so affected by the
sorrow of the people, the guards and judges, that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_431' id='Page_431'>431</a></span>
neither in the palace nor on the way could he utter a
word, his speech stifled by his sobs.</p>

<p class='c010' >‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Thou</span> continued his journey, repeating
an hundred times, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Credidi propter quod locutus sum,</span>”
making the priest promise that he should be allowed
to recite the whole on the scaffold ere he died.</p>

<p class='c010' >‘Arrived on the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place des Terreaux,</span> Father Malavette
first descended, taking <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le Grand</span> and
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Thou</span> by the hand, and saying these
words, “Go, sir; a moment will part us now, but soon
shall we be united before God and to all eternity.
Do not regret that which you lose; you have been
great on earth, you will be greater in heaven, and your
grandeur will have no fall.” And having embraced
once again with last tokens of friendship, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le
Grand</span> descended from the coach, and some insolent
soldiers attempting to tear his cloak from him, he
turned to the provost marshal and asked to whom it
should be given. He bade him dispose of it as he
chose, and he gave it to the priest’s companion, desiring
that its price might be bestowed on the poor.
Another soldier having taken his hat, he asked him for
it civilly, and it was returned, and he ascended the
scaffold, having his head covered, with graceful agility
and gaiety kissing his hand ere he gave it to Malavette
to assist him to reach the summit. He took a turn
on the scaffold, still wearing his hat, and bowing round
to the crowd with his fine and majestic countenance.
Then he flung his hat from him, and knelt down,
raising his eyes to heaven in adoration. Next approaching
the block, he made trial of it, asking how he
should place himself and whether he did well. He
took the crucifix from the priest’s hand himself on
his knees, and kissed it with a tenderness inconceivable.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_432' id='Page_432'>432</a></span>
And as he repeated the action a thousand times, the
father called aloud to the people to pray for him; and
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le Grand,</span> stretching forth his arms and then
clasping the hands which still held the crucifix,
repeated a like prayer.</p>

<p class='c010' >‘The executioner now approached, but the father
bade him retire, and turning <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cinq Mars</span> from him, his
companion aided to undo the doublet, and then <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur
le Grand</span> embraced them both, and kneeling they
recited together “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ave Maria, stella,</span>” and at its
close he received absolution, and casting himself in the
priest’s arms remained there while one might say a
Miserere.</p>

<p class='c010' >‘The executioner again advancing to cut the hair,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Cinq Mars</span> asked for scissors. The
father took them from his hand and gave them to
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le Grand,</span> who called the priest’s companion,
desiring he would cut it, and this he did, and he laid
his head on the block to try it again, and the father
gave a medal into his hand and he received indulgence
and kissed the cross. He then kneeled
down with wondrous tranquillity, begging of the
priest’s companion that he would continue to hold the
crucifix before his eyes which he refused to have
bound, in order that he might see it till he died.
Embracing the block, he placed himself thereon and
received the mortal blow from a large butcher’s knife,
made after the fashion of the antique axes or rather
like those of England, and the one blow ended him,
though the head still held to the trunk by the skin of
the throat not quite severed. The executioner was an
old needy wretch. Unnerved by the necessity of
cutting through this skin which remained, and letting
the head roll on the scaffold, it fell unto the ground.</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_433' id='Page_433'>433</a></span>
‘The people, densely crowded on the square, at the
windows and on the towers, broke through the breathless
silence which had lasted throughout, and when the
axe was raised, uttered a wild cry. The sobs and
groans recommenced with a noise and tumult altogether
startling.</p>

<p class='c010' >‘After this, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Thou,</span> who had remained
within the coach which had been closed, came forth
from it boldly, and ascended the scaffold with such
alertness that one might have thought he flew, and
arrived at its summit he took two turns hat in hand,
bowing to the multitude; then flung in a corner his hat
and the cloak, and the executioner approaching embraced
him and called him brother, and stripped his
doublet without a moment’s delay.</p>

<p class='c010' >‘Father Mambrun who accompanied him was so
profoundly affected as to be unable to utter a word.
He begged Father Malavette, who had descended while
the assistants stripped the body of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cinq Mars,</span> to return
and he did so. They recited the psalm “Credidi”
together and aloud, and after ejaculations uttered in a
firm and loud voice, in a transport and fervour like that
of a seraphim, and gestures which seemed as if his
body yielded to his soul flying to heaven, he received
absolution and gained the indulgence.</p>

<p class='c010' >‘And having performed all Christian duties, he
adored the cross ere yet he lay his head on the block,
then kissed the blood of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cinq Mars</span> which stained it,
and bound his eyes himself with his kerchief. Having
taken his post, he received a blow on the bones of the
skull which grazed it only and he passed his hand on
the wound falling backwards. The executioner repeated
the blow, grazing the skull once more, this time
above the ear, casting his victim down who kicked
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_434' id='Page_434'>434</a></span>
violently in his agony. The executioner dealt yet a third
blow on the throat which finished him, and he received
yet two more ere he could cut the head completely off—so
embarrassed was this wretched executioner. His
body was then stripped instantly, and the two bodies
being placed in a coach were borne to the church
of the Feuillans.</p>

<p class='c010' >‘The next morning the corpse of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Thou</span>
was embalmed by order of his sister and carried
thence; and that of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le Grand</span> was interred
under the balustrade of the said church, through the
goodness and authority of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Gay,</span> treasurer
of France.</p>

<p class='c010' >‘Thus died these two great men, expiating by religion
and constancy the enormity of their crime.’</p>
